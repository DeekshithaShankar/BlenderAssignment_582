Meeting Notes for2024-11-12 Render & Cycles Meeting

For 4.3
Phase functions
Need images for the phase functions
Lukas reached out to some artists and they’ll send some images, which is great!
Lukas and Sebastian will make the underwater caustics scene small and usable for all sorts of tests and comparisons
Manual update for phase functions
Ensure new functions are listed and should be easy to tackle
Images are great, but can come later
Path guiding might need tweaking: use RIS for volume as well
Crashes, when using Smoke and cycles (AMD HIP) #126566
WIP: Handling SDK/ROCm 6+ lack of backward compatibility with pre ROCm 6 #130153
Overall seems the safest for 4.3, and 4.2
For 4.3 allow this “mixed” configurations (Windows builders uses ROCm 5, while Linux builders are ROCm6)
For the JIT kernel compilation assume ROCm6. If ROCm 5 is detected return an error
blender_debug_cycles.bat
Seems the solution everyone is fine with
Need to communicate to the triaging team, to ensure the best quality of Cycles information is provided
Embree crash on Simplify toggle #129596
Fix requires upgrade Embree
Not specific to 4.3. Annoying, safest is to tackle for 4.4
For the 4.2 it is not impossible to backport fix and library update. But best is to re-evaluate it when the fix is ready for 4.4
Other
Weizhen: Cycles: Unbiased volume rendering #128389
Getting closer to a state when we can split off octtree part to separate PR, and aim for landing
Lukas: WIP: Cycles: Support for custom OSL cameras #129495
Lead to general OSL improvements:
Cycles: Use fused OptiX OSL programs #130149
Cycles: Make OSL shader compilation threadsafe and multi-threaded #130133
Compositor Denoising on GPU
Tricky part: select which GPU to use
But work is going!
Library updates: Update OpenPGL to latest version for WoA
