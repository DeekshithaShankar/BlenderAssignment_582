Mon, Oct 14, 2024, 02:10:11 - @povmaniac:blender.org: Morning, guys
Mon, Oct 14, 2024, 03:36:05 - @fclem:blender.org: Can someone cancel https://builder.blender.org/admin/#/builders/136/builds/7947
Mon, Oct 14, 2024, 03:37:44 - Bastien Montagne: Clément Foucault: done
Mon, Oct 14, 2024, 04:08:37 - @fclem:blender.org: LazyDodo Sergey : sooo seems like cmake doesn't refresh the content of a file even if its original file is updated.
```
/mnt/data/Blender/blender/source/blender/draw/intern/shaders/draw_debug_info.hh
```
 It was previously wrongly generated by the glsl_preprocessor (last monday fackup). But it seems that this stale version sticks even after the source file `draw_debug_info.hh` gets updated.

 Any pointers?
Mon, Oct 14, 2024, 04:09:52 - @fclem:blender.org: It broke building of my PR on one buildbot. But I can reproduce locally.
Mon, Oct 14, 2024, 04:16:22 - Wu Yiming: Sergey: Can we iterate into all evaluated instances of an object like `DEG_OBJECT_ITER_BEGIN` but only with a given object list? [regarding this](https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/pulls/128890#issuecomment-1317643)
Mon, Oct 14, 2024, 04:26:48 - @sergey:blender.org: Clément Foucault: Missing DEPENDS?

Mon, Oct 14, 2024, 06:02:32 - @memm:blender.org: Hi, can anyone explain how to find out which C struct the bpy_struct as_pointer() points to? For example `C.edit_object.data.vertices[0].as_pointer()` gives the memory address, but which internal C struct does this apply to? I looked through the RNA generation to try and find the answer but it's not very easy to figure out
Mon, Oct 14, 2024, 06:08:07 - memm changed their display name to Memm
Mon, Oct 14, 2024, 06:08:51 - @memm:blender.org set a profile picture
Mon, Oct 14, 2024, 06:11:16 - @fclem:blender.org: Long story short (thanks a lot to sergey for looking into it):

The line `file(GENERATE OUTPUT ${shader_create_info_list_file} CONTENT "${SHADER_CREATE_INFOS_CONTENT}")` breaks dependency tracking between create infos and the gpu module.

Which means that any changes to the `info.hh` files are not tracked properly. It wørks by accident on the buildbot because it runs CMake for each build.

Mon, Oct 14, 2024, 06:19:23 - LazyDodo: is this fixed now? 
Mon, Oct 14, 2024, 06:31:28 - @fclem:blender.org: Weeeeeellll
Mon, Oct 14, 2024, 06:38:43 - LazyDodo: that's 9 more characters than no would have been 🙂
Mon, Oct 14, 2024, 06:41:13 - LazyDodo: either way, if it's not fixed, add_custom_command  allows you to set DEPENDS which should take care of the issue

Mon, Oct 14, 2024, 07:16:13 - Pablo Vazquez: ah yes, needs updating though 
Mon, Oct 14, 2024, 07:16:21 - Pablo Vazquez: "how to get your add-on included and maintain it." is no longer valid 
Mon, Oct 14, 2024, 07:17:22 - Pablo Vazquez: it should point to https://projects.blender.org/extensions , and update the chat link 
Mon, Oct 14, 2024, 07:19:14 - Nika Kutsniashvili: I think Extensions tag/submodule might be needed for Blender repository, for tasks related to "whatever Campbell is doing". It's very ambiguous where to direct bugs about internet connection problems and install/uninstall problems
Mon, Oct 14, 2024, 07:19:42 - Nika Kutsniashvili: Same will be true for assets I'm assuming once they're on platform.

Mon, Oct 14, 2024, 11:27:02 - Jesse Y: For 0.5 you can use a single Round node, but for the others you need this setup because some formats, like USD and glTF, define their alpha-clip equivalent in terms of "greater than equals" and blender has no Greater Than Equals

Mon, Oct 14, 2024, 18:27:17 - John Kiril Swenson: Why is it that some keymaps don't show up unless you search for them in the Keymap preferences? E.g. you can't find `km_time_scrub` or `km_time_scrub_clip` items until you look up "change frame." Is it because they only have 1 item each?

I think this could lead to trouble; if you accidentally delete the items there's no way of restoring them from the preferences interface as far as I can tell, other than restoring everything to default

(I ask because I'm trying to fix a bug related to those items)

https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/src/branch/blender-v4.3-release/release/text/readme.html

README needs to be updated to chat.blender.org channels.
And maybe instead of User Forum we link to blender.org/community instead of BA?
Tue, Oct 15, 2024, 03:56:58 - Thomas Dinges: Fine with me, I can do that. Pablo Vazquez Any comments or objections? ^^
Tue, Oct 15, 2024, 03:58:01 - @dfelinto:blender.org: I was about to do it but then had to remember how to link to a channel now, ... and it was getting me distracted from the daunting font license task :)
Tue, Oct 15, 2024, 03:58:30 - @dfelinto:blender.org: `/me` found this by trying to find if Blender even ships with a .ttf these days, then I found the readme.html, and surprise, it was outdated :/
Tue, Oct 15, 2024, 04:01:54 - Pablo Vazquez: eeek we were linking straight to blenderartists? better do blender.org/community indeed

Tue, Oct 15, 2024, 05:08:34 - Thomas Dinges: I already heard that glew is not used anymore
Tue, Oct 15, 2024, 05:55:46 - LazyDodo: There's some questionable things in there thomas, where you pretty much will have to dive into what is expected from us, cause i honestly don't know
Tue, Oct 15, 2024, 05:56:46 - LazyDodo: ie flex, it's a build time dep, we _need_ it to build OSL (it generates OSL's parser), but we don't actually ship it
Tue, Oct 15, 2024, 05:59:15 - LazyDodo: same goes for ispc and nasm
Tue, Oct 15, 2024, 06:00:11 - LazyDodo: dpc++ we ship to devs, but beyond its compiler output we don't ship it to end users
Tue, Oct 15, 2024, 06:00:52 - LazyDodo: Message deleted
Tue, Oct 15, 2024, 06:19:04 - @dfelinto:blender.org: LazyDodo: I think he means more like ... is there any library which Blender doesn't use at all, and we forgot to remove as a depedency
Tue, Oct 15, 2024, 06:19:25 - @dfelinto:blender.org: (which was the case for glew, since we use epoxy now and glew was just dead weight on the code)
Tue, Oct 15, 2024, 06:31:59 - LazyDodo: Dalai Felinto: my point is "depends on your definition of the word 'used'"
Tue, Oct 15, 2024, 06:32:46 - LazyDodo: harbfbuzz for instance, blender doesn't use _at all_, but we definitely didn't forget to remove it , it's there since the UI module asked for preliminary libs, so they could work on integrating it
Tue, Oct 15, 2024, 06:42:09 - @dfelinto:blender.org: interesting, it does mean that technically we shouldn't mention harbfbuzz on the license doc
Tue, Oct 15, 2024, 06:43:22 - LazyDodo: the same can be said for ispc/nasm/flex, we ship the artifacts it produces, but we don't actually ship any of its actual binaries
Tue, Oct 15, 2024, 06:43:51 - Thomas Dinges: LukasStockner: Hey, did you ever look into updating zstd? We're on 1.5.0 since the initial inclusion 2 years ago, current one is 1.5.6 and these point releases since then brought both fixes and further performance improvements. Just an idea :)
Tue, Oct 15, 2024, 06:44:13 - LazyDodo: Thomas Dinges:  think we got stuck on some version because of sometihng python causing linkage issues when you mixed versions
Tue, Oct 15, 2024, 06:45:10 - @dfelinto:blender.org: Thomas Dinges: what do you think? we could have SET(LIBNAME_NOTUSED) or something
Tue, Oct 15, 2024, 06:45:43 - Thomas Dinges: More like LIBNAME_NOTSHIPPED? I mean if they are used as dependency for libs?
Tue, Oct 15, 2024, 06:46:03 - LazyDodo: `LIBNAME_BUILDTIMEONLY` ? or perhaps `LIBNAME_DEPSBUILDTIMEONLY` ?
Tue, Oct 15, 2024, 06:46:28 - Thomas Dinges: I already have a headache. Would prefer to do one thing at a time, which is porting everything from OSS to the new system. Cleanups and further improvements can be done later
Tue, Oct 15, 2024, 06:46:57 - @dfelinto:blender.org: hehe, I feel you

Tue, Oct 15, 2024, 08:29:03 - @lukasstockner:blender.org: The problem is that OpenVDB currently builds its own Zstd (with different options, e.g. no multithreading) and includes it in its static lib, and at least on Linux the linker prefers that over our intended Zstd.

I'm not at my work computer until 10 hours from now. So if you can commit `make format` commit to the 4.3 branch that would be great

Tue, Oct 15, 2024, 15:33:49 - @zeddb:blender.org: Yeah...
I don't think I could have screwed up with the library bump either as there is only 2 .py files that changed (code wise, the rest is just metadata installed by the libraries)
Tue, Oct 15, 2024, 15:35:47 - @zeddb:blender.org: I'll take a look at it when I wake up tomorrow

Should do the trick, just want to check all the python modules download, install, and work properly on all three main operating systems.  Didn't want to buy a mac, so I was installing blender and my addons at the local computer store earlier.  Got some stack traces, cycled 3 miles home, fixed the problems, re-uploaded to dropbox, and then went back and installed blender again + the 4 GB of libraries and models :D  Thankfully only needed 2 trips :)
Tue, Oct 15, 2024, 15:47:16 - LazyDodo: also think there may be a rather sizable difference between home users and the studio's that participated in the survey, things like redhat/centos are mainly attractive for corporate envs home user will likely want something flashier
Tue, Oct 15, 2024, 15:48:52 - 3di: what do you think is most likely going to be used by home users?  I'm not really sure which is the flashiest.
Tue, Oct 15, 2024, 15:49:45 - 3di: Does the blender download page collect OS information when people download?  Besides just windows, mac intel/metal, linux I mean.
Tue, Oct 15, 2024, 15:53:20 - LazyDodo: don't think so, and if it does i have no access to such stats, you could check the [steam hardware survey](https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/)

Tue, Oct 15, 2024, 20:38:27 - @nikhil.net:blender.org: Not sure it's worth a bugrep, but the "`Alignment of class vec is not in accordance with SYCL specification requirements, a limitation of the MSVC compiler(Error C2719).Requested alignment applied, limited at 64.`" message is back since a few weeks ago on Win64 (with correct toolchain and libraries). Not sure if the buildbot will catch it since it looks like the GPU build task is set to disabled on that build. I can file a report if anyone thinks there's value, but don't want to spam devs if it's not worth the trouble.
Tue, Oct 15, 2024, 20:53:59 - LazyDodo: not sure what you want us to do here? it's an msvc limitation
Tue, Oct 15, 2024, 20:54:45 - @nikhil.net:blender.org: there was a post on an issue (wrong # - finding it now) that an include had fixed it and was not sure if this was a similar situation.  Like I said, just checking to make sure it was even actionable. Or, if it's a known issue, is it worth just suppressing C2719?  Seems emitting known warnings is probably not optimal.  But maybe that's my OCD talking. (Also, for what it's worth, disabling that preprocessor check does compile without any warnings, but I don't have an Intel GPU to test if the generated kernel is OK or not.)

you can get statistics from blender benchmark submissions, from what I remember there is a tie between Arch Linux and Ubuntu - quite different from what studio use :)

I've checked the source: this message is not really actionable, and it's not even a  warning. C2719 would be an error, this message talks about C2719 but is just a message coming from here: https://github.com/intel/llvm/blob/d2817d6d317db1143bb227168e85c409d5ab7c82/sycl/include/sycl/types.hpp#L331
It will be gone by upgrading to newer DPC++ versions: the fix was to update the spec so max alignment could be 64, which aligns with MSVC limitations.
If we want, the ` #pragma message` can be patched out from `include/sycl/types.hpp` without recompiling.

Wed, Oct 16, 2024, 02:04:39 - Bastien Montagne: Sergey: not a strong one, but opinion would be to try to catch up on windows/OSX ASAP yes...
Easy to say since I don't think I can help on either though ☹️
Wed, Oct 16, 2024, 02:04:59 - Bastien Montagne: But if it's too much of a mess, not against reverting to 1.6 on linux for the time being either
Wed, Oct 16, 2024, 02:06:39 - @sergey:blender.org: I think it's better to:
- make format in 4.3, merge to main
- fix the warning making 2.3.1 the official expected autopep8
- motivate platform maintainers to do updates on Windows / macOS
Wed, Oct 16, 2024, 02:07:07 - @sergey:blender.org: I can take care of macOS, unless that will be stepping on Jonas Holzman 's toes
Wed, Oct 16, 2024, 02:08:29 - Bastien Montagne: Sergey: I can do the make format and fix the warning...
Wed, Oct 16, 2024, 02:08:45 - @sean-kim:blender.org: One weird thing mentioned earlier about the initial PR updating the autopep8 to 2.3.1 on linux is that there werent any files affected

Wed, Oct 16, 2024, 02:11:05 - @sean-kim:blender.org: Dunno, Lazy and Sebastian both mentioned they didnt notice it during initial testing either 
Wed, Oct 16, 2024, 02:11:28 - Bastien Montagne: Any preference for the `MIN_VERSION`? `2.3.0` ?
Wed, Oct 16, 2024, 02:11:50 - Bastien Montagne: Or should we keep min and max the same as currently (`1.6.0`)?
Wed, Oct 16, 2024, 02:12:04 - ideasman42: When I ran the formatter, the result was the same on 1.6 & 2.3.1.
So I didn't think it would be an issue to have the older version on other platforms for a short time.
Wed, Oct 16, 2024, 02:13:08 - Bastien Montagne: ideasman42: there are quite a few differences here for me!
Wed, Oct 16, 2024, 02:13:12 - @sergey:blender.org: ideasman42: Hrm. That's odd. The formatting is different for buildbot and for Falk =\
Wed, Oct 16, 2024, 02:13:14 - ideasman42: We should have min version 2.3.0 or so, at least once all platforms have been updated. Else bugs in the old formatter can be committed to our repo.
Wed, Oct 16, 2024, 02:14:47 - @sergey:blender.org: Is there some autopep8 configuration which might have different default value or something?

Wed, Oct 16, 2024, 02:17:02 - @sergey:blender.org: Thing i am not sure is: should we try to get to the bottom of why initial testing didn't show difference in format?

> depth ordered all items occluded, where any fully occluded pixels are omitted.

I am not sure I get this part. Does it mean: select all object by their visible pixels and then order them by dpeth?

Also wøuld be nice to know how to test each mode.

From what I understand, there is conceptually only 2 selection mode, one for selecting everything and one for selecting only frontmost surfaces with occlusion. Am I right?
Wed, Oct 16, 2024, 02:18:06 - Bastien Montagne: ideasman42: most changes are like that:

Wed, Oct 16, 2024, 03:54:57 - @zeddb:blender.org: Yepp good to get extra confirmation. If it seems like it is indeed gone, we can remove the patch and the references in the licence files
Wed, Oct 16, 2024, 03:55:16 - @zeddb:blender.org: But from what I can tell it is indeed 100% gone, no code seem to use it.
Wed, Oct 16, 2024, 03:55:41 - Falk David: Bart van der Braak Any ideas how Matias Mendiola could troubleshoot ?
Wed, Oct 16, 2024, 03:56:22 - @sergey:blender.org: Thomas Dinges: It as a library bindled into OpenColorIO. With the switch to OCIO 2.x it is no longer there
Wed, Oct 16, 2024, 03:56:59 - Thomas Dinges: Sergey: So for 4.2 and above I can remove it from the license file?
Wed, Oct 16, 2024, 03:58:26 - @bartvdbraak:blender.org: Matias Mendiola: Just as sanity check, you can reach others (e.g. Github via `ssh -v git@github.com`)?
Wed, Oct 16, 2024, 03:58:49 - @sergey:blender.org: Thomas Dinges: Can even be removed from 3.6

Wed, Oct 16, 2024, 04:06:50 - @mmendio:blender.org: Not now
Wed, Oct 16, 2024, 04:07:25 - @bartvdbraak:blender.org: Then I reckon it shouldn't be causing this issue.
Wed, Oct 16, 2024, 04:07:55 - @mmendio:blender.org: I'll try with other network and let you know

Wed, Oct 16, 2024, 05:19:19 - @bartvdbraak:blender.org: Most likely a safety/security setting within your router.
Wed, Oct 16, 2024, 05:23:25 - @bartvdbraak:blender.org: Some routers or ISPs block specific ports for security reasons. Check if port 22 is being blocked either by your router or ISP.

Some routers have built-in firewalls that can block outbound or inbound connections to specific ports. If your router’s firewall is configured too restrictively, it might be blocking outgoing SSH traffic.

If UPnP is enabled on your router, it might be automatically redirecting or filtering traffic in a way that affects your ability to use SSH.

Wed, Oct 16, 2024, 05:47:32 - @charliejolly:blender.org: <@lukastonne:blender.org "> No space left on device: 'libm..."> 😝 I completely misread that as a different kind of test!

Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 01:07:09 - @memm:blender.org: Are there any plans for making Blender more easily extendible? For example, getting data through the python API is extremely slow for C applications, and it feels that as_pointer() is meant to be more for internal use, not for addons. Is anyone at BF thinking about opening Blender up more to be modifiable by 3rd party extensions or do you prefer to keep it closed? What are the BF developers' feelings in this area? What do you see happening here in the future?
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 01:07:49 - Thomas Dinges: See our FAQ https://developer.blender.org/docs/handbook/new_developers/faq/#can-a-c-plugin-api-be-added
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 01:09:27 - @memm:blender.org: I've seen that, but what I"m asking is whether anybody currently cares about making it more modular? Regardless of difficulty etc... is anyone actively looking into this area?
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 01:09:59 - Thomas Dinges: Not that I am aware
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 01:11:01 - @memm:blender.org: Have you heard Ton talk about it at all? I'm wondering whether you think making blender more modular / open for 3rd party development is something you think is important for Blender's future?
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 01:12:02 - @memm:blender.org: Just trying to gouge the feelings around this area, not the technical side per se but if you think this area is important for Blender in general or not.
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 01:12:52 - Thomas Dinges: There is not only the technical side, the questions is also whether there are actual benefits. Imagine a Blender ecosystem, where people have to buy 10 plugins in order to really use it. If there would be a C++ API, it's likely people would rather develop a commercial plugin rather than improving the feature in Blender itself freely available for anyone
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 01:14:52 - @memm:blender.org: That's one side of this, yes. But on the other hand imagine having 1000 more developers, especially for experimental / research features that nobody at BF would touch internally and would never happen otherwise.
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 01:16:31 - @memm:blender.org: It also means less code reviewing and more experimentation, because addon developers are responsible for their addons working, not you.
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 01:20:26 - @memm:blender.org: You might also have a pipeline where addons get integrated into blender after first being tested outside of it.
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 01:30:52 - Falk David: Personally, I'm fine with Blender not being attractive to C++ addon developers. To me, that's a feature rather than a bug.
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 01:31:47 - Falk David: I think a future where Blender is attractive to developers who want to contribute to Blender itself is a better future.
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 01:34:25 - @memm:blender.org: The way I see it is addons are the gateway to that.
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 01:35:07 - @memm:blender.org: How else will you make Blender attractive to developers?
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 01:36:38 - Falk David: By improving the code quality, making it more readable, hackable, better code documentation on developer.blender.org/docs etc etc.
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 01:37:20 - Falk David: From my experience, it's moving in that direction. I've seen more people jump on board than ever
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 01:40:13 - @memm:blender.org: Jump on board to do what?
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 01:41:15 - Falk David: To contribute to the project. Writing PRs, proposing ideas, etc.
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 01:41:39 - @memm:blender.org: For example I've noticed lately a lot of addons experimenting with SDF. Has anyone proposed implementing that in the core?
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 01:43:26 - Falk David: There have been some proposals yea. Maybe not the type of SDF that you're thinking about. See e.g. https://devtalk.blender.org/t/sdf-functions/11055
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 01:43:47 - @memm:blender.org: There are already at least 4 or 5 addons working in that area. And there are already multiple applications outside of Blender that have implemented it. My question is why are they doing it as addons, or putting into Autodesk apps, instead of contributing this into Blender?
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 01:44:14 - Falk David: You'd have to ask them!
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 01:45:59 - @memm:blender.org: Maybe there are reason I don't understand but I think it comes down to just two: A) big features need funding and B) it's easier
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 01:49:15 - Falk David: For A) I think a lot of people are still stuck in the mindset of "why would I spend money on making something that will be open-sourced?". And yea I agree with B) but I don't think the solution is for the Blender project to spend  time and resources on a C++ API that would make it easier for others to spend _less_ time and resources on Blender to then publish a commercial addon that makes them money, but doesn't help the goal of the Blender project.
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 01:52:36 - @memm:blender.org: Well the SDF thread you linked the last post was from almost 2 years ago and it looks like it never made it past code review, even though everyone liked it.
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 01:53:36 - @memm:blender.org: Compare that to simply making an addon, putting it online and if it works, users are happy. Bypassing any other red tape.
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 01:55:55 - Falk David: From what I can tell, code review never began because the patch wasn't finished.
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 01:56:33 - Falk David: Last commit on the branch was still WIP development
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 01:57:01 - @memm:blender.org: It might be more productive to find a way to bring commercial addons into the core of Blender, rather than just not having them at all.
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 01:57:36 - Falk David: See my point above.
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 01:57:51 - Falk David: > I don't think the solution is for the Blender project to spend time and resources on a C++ API that would make it easier for others to spend less time and resources on Blender to then publish a commercial addon that makes them money, but doesn't help the goal of the Blender project.
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 02:01:29 - @memm:blender.org: Yeah but like I said I don't think it will stop people from contributing to Blender, just like the Python API doesn't stop it now. It would instead incentivise outside development that you could then potentially bring inside.
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 02:02:59 - Falk David: That's too big of an *potentially* for it to justify working on a multi-year project imho. It's much more productive to improve the things I've mentioned to bring in contributors.
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 02:06:06 - @memm:blender.org: Well it's a risk, sure, but there's also a risk of Blender falling behind while all the interesting graphics research is taken up by other software, or addons half-hacked into Blender through the current API.
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 02:08:40 - Falk David: Well I think the opposite is true. If you look at the numbers, Blender tends to be more popular than ever.
But even if Blender were to "fall behind", that's ok. There's no "risk". Blender is not a commercial product that needs the stock to go up to survive.
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 02:17:34 - @memm:blender.org: What does Blender need to continue living in your opinion?
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 02:18:39 - @memm:blender.org: It's more popular than ever, but there's also more 3D software than ever.

I think there will always be young developers excited about 3D, downloading blenders source and start hacking on it. So as long as that keeps happening, I'm not worried about the Blender project dying out.

Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 02:26:19 - @memm:blender.org: Fair enough. Well I'm just opening the topic up for conversation, would be interesting to see what others think about how "open" Blender should be to development.
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 02:28:36 - Falk David: Yes I think that's a conversation that we should regularly have. If others think that it's too hard to contribute to Blender, then we need to look at whatever we can do to improve it. 
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 02:29:14 - @zeddb:blender.org: Blender not having a C++ API is actually enforcing more openness.
It is a bit like the MIT vs GPL discussions.
One gives the freedom to the end user and the other to the masses.

Ton has been quite clear that our goal is to provide freedom to the masses. Not the individual user.
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 02:29:34 - Falk David: (And also figure out what the real reasons are the people don't contribute)
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 02:37:16 - @memm:blender.org: <@zeddb:blender.org "Blender not having a C++ API is ..."> That's a really interesting take! I'll have to think about that.
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 02:58:13 - @memm:blender.org: Sebastian Parborg: do think it's possible to have both? Freedom to the users and masses.
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 03:01:12 - @zeddb:blender.org: No, because the freedom of the individual includes taking away freedom from the masses.
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 03:19:33 - @memm:blender.org: Hmm, but the C++ API would still be GPL, shouldn't be much different from the Python API. As long as you're developing around Blender your software will also be GPL. So at any point, even for a commercial addon, you can take the code and put it inside Blender if you really want to.
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 03:20:59 - @memm:blender.org: At least legally, ethically is a different question.
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 03:34:36 - @memm:blender.org: Might sound weird but what if you had a kind of agreement that commercial projects using the C++ API would after some number of years become part of Blender's core.

Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 04:22:28 - Falk David: Leaving all the challenges and issues with such an agreement aside, why would someone agree to do this if they can contribute to Blender directly?
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 04:36:53 - @memm:blender.org: Contribute what? Small bug fixes and such can be done for free, but larger projects that takes a year or more can't be done without funding or some commercial incentive.
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 04:37:38 - @memm:blender.org: Blender is open source but it's not "free" to develop. Everyone working at BF gets paid, and Blender has funding and grants.
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 04:41:30 - @memm:blender.org: Developers need strong motivation to contribute. Otherwise projects die half way through when the poor students find a job or just give up. :)
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 04:44:10 - Jeroen Bakker: Might be that it uses a software renderer and not your GPU. I can imagine that this is a limitation of RDP protocol as the server (Windows) doesn't have access to the GPU on your client (Ubuntu)
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 04:51:22 - @zeddb:blender.org: There is nothing preventing people from doing their own fundraisers and or getting outside funding to get features into Blender.

Introducing more external APIs will not change this.
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 04:59:59 - Falk David: > Contribute what?

I was responding to what you said:

> commercial projects using the C++ API would after some number of years become part of Blender's core

My question then was, if someone agreed that their code would be contributed to Blender after some time, why not contribute directly?

My point is basically that anyone who wants to write something using the C++ API could just as well write the change directly into Blenders internal C++ API. And the ones who wouldn't want to contribute to Blender directly also wouldn't agree to what you propose.
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 05:03:10 - Falk David: <@memm:blender.org "Developers need strong motivatio..."> Yes. I'd argue that this is ok. We need people that are motivated to do something, without ouside incentive. The issue becomes when those people can't contribute because of some failiure in the process.
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 05:08:03 - Falk David: Of course there are also contributors that are hired by companies, e.g. NVIDIA, Apple, etc. and hopefully more companies and studios start to do this in the future.

Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 05:39:53 - 3di: Jeroen Bakker: thanks.  I thought the ubuntu machine would still be using the gpu, and just streaming the display output back to the windows machine via rdp.  I'll have to investigate further 👍

Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 07:59:45 - Maeve: <@lazydodo:blender.org "Maeve: no, single process, so no..."> Ah okay, thanks
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 08:01:55 - LazyDodo: we had a pr once that integrated crashpad that used IPC, that could handle more complex crashes (you're kind of out of luck right now with lets say a stack overflow) and stalls, but that never made it to mainline blender
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 08:02:15 - Raiko: Message deleted
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 09:59:16 - LazyDodo: Falk David: looks like that 4.3 merge didn't go super well and broke main https://builder.blender.org/admin/#/builders/9/builds/19053
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 10:00:00 - SensArice: The file sorter given to me by my boss currently includes dirent, which is not cross-platform, and therefore cannot be smoothly integrated into the Blender source code. so I what do？
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 10:00:50 - Christoph Lendenfeld: also just stumbled upon this
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 10:00:51 - LazyDodo: sensarice: I'd probably see what functionality it uses and see if std::filesystem can provide it?
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 10:01:50 - @antonioya:blender.org: There is a compiler error in line 465 in `interface_utils.cc`  Thre is a wrong `endif`related to baklava project
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 10:02:15 - @antonioya:blender.org: it looks that dr.Sybren missed to remove this line ;-)
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 10:02:32 - LazyDodo: actually it was fine in 4.3 it's  a merge error
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 10:02:45 - dr.Sybren: Nope, that was a move of the `#ifdef` guards in a PR by Jacques Lucke , which wasn't merged properly to `main`
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 10:03:04 - SensArice: In order to transform the company's internal code into code that can be contributed to Blender, I seem to need to do a lot of rewriting.
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 10:03:22 - @antonioya:blender.org: I hope this is the unique merge error 
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 10:06:10 - dr.Sybren: I'll take a look, should be an easy fix
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 10:11:42 - LazyDodo: probably best to check with the governing module and see if the functionality is wanted before you pour in a whole bunch of time on something that won't clear code review
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 10:12:45 - dr.Sybren: Fix committed & pushed
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 10:13:10 - Falk David: Thanks people, hope I didn't cause too much trouble 
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 10:13:46 - dr.Sybren: I made a mistake, which was fixed by Jacques, which then got merged by you, and then fixed by me again :)
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 10:14:19 - Falk David: 😅
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 10:22:08 - @antonioya:blender.org: team work!

Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 11:36:17 - @povmaniac:blender.org: Any clue about how to remove( or maybe we can ignore..) this warning when I make some RGB only render from my engine?
`Warning: Reading render result: expected channel "ViewLayer.Combined.A" or "Combined.A" not found`
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 11:38:32 - @povmaniac:blender.org: I use `layer.load_from_file(img_file_path)`at render end
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 11:41:33 - @povmaniac:blender.org: I have localized the exact point of this  code into 'render_result.cc' lines 965 and 974

Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 11:45:51 - kursadk: Blender starts these processes for the shader compilation, but it never kills them. Is that by design? 
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 11:51:23 - Iliya Katushenock: Hard to reproduce to me so i didn't report this yet..
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 11:51:47 - Iliya Katushenock: kursadk: Do you see anything in the terminal of the blender?
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 11:52:57 - kursadk: <@mod:blender.org "kursadk: Do you see anything in ..."> I have these all the time, might be a Win 11 thing. I will check the terminal
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 11:56:25 - LazyDodo: kursadk: throwing stuff at the wall, have you had frequent crashes? i could see if the main blender exe crashes the childen may stick around?
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 11:58:53 - kursadk: Well I get crashes here and there. These are within the open Blender session. 
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 12:02:30 - LazyDodo: oh i misread that, thought they were stale processes 
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 12:02:39 - LazyDodo: afaik these guys stay around until you close blender
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 12:05:37 - kursadk: <@lazydodo:blender.org "afaik these guys stay around unt..."> Thanks,  Just double-checked to confirm there aren't any actual problems with it.
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 12:59:30 - 3di: finally got it sorted.  Putting solution here incase it's handy for anyone else wanting to control blender on ubuntu via rdp from windows 11.

Needed to join an already open session on ubuntu using desktop sharing and remote control, rather than remotely logging in.   Which meant setting user to auto log in when the machine boots up.  Then to get smooth movement in the 3d viewport needed to disable continuous grab.

This is using the built in rdp in the latest Ubuntu, which required that xrdp was not installed (otherwise you get a second authentication screen which doesn't allow you through even with the correct credentials.).
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 13:08:27 - 3di: spoke too soon, only works if there's a monitor connected to the host.
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 18:00:46 - LazyDodo: ideasman42: looks like you broke `make_update.py` all bots are [failing](https://builder.blender.org/admin/#/builders/10/builds/18984) currently , can you take a peek?
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 18:11:27 - mushroomeo joined the room
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 18:13:03 - mushroomeo: hi i wanted ask why isnt blenders transform cursor speed fixed for wayland still ?
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 18:13:54 - mushroomeo: now that finaly can use wayland very good on linux nvidia gpu on KDE 6.2 and i see that ubuntu latest release is even default wayland
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 18:14:28 - mushroomeo: but if you move object in blender or rotate or even nodes then the speed of cursor is slow
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 18:14:47 - mushroomeo: or is it only me?
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 18:16:10 - mushroomeo: becauswe of that i need to switch to X11 eveytime i want use blender which really sucks...
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 18:23:21 - ideasman42: LazyDodo: checking, the built-bot uses an old Python version, will correct & note in comments not to use new features in these scripts.
_Committed fix._
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 19:12:26 - ideasman42: mushroomeo it's unlikely we can resolve issues relating to NVidia performance on Wayland, as it's most likely a driver problem.
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 19:14:18 - ideasman42: There is some chance it's can be handled on Blender's side, is there a bug report for this?
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 22:00:15 - @memm:blender.org: Hi, a small question:
From what I understand rna_mesh.cc are using the data definitions from DNA_meshdata_types.h, for example rna_def_mvert() is linked to the struct MVert. But that struct is deprecated, in the code it says:
"Deprecated mesh vertex data structure. Now stored with generic attributes."

So on the python side something like data.vertices[0] are still linked to the above data structure, but because it's deprecated will this be changed in the future? I'm trying to understand if the deprecation will impact how data can accessed, or if this is safe to use.
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 22:18:23 - Jesse Y: You can use the common `attributes` accessor nowadays for general access to anything that's been attached to the geometry:
```python
# Move the "Cube" object up 1 unit on the Z axis
for v in bpy.data.objects["Cube"].data.attributes["position"].data:
    v.vector.z += 1.0
```
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 22:30:12 - @memm:blender.org: I see, but the mesh data doesn't seem to be part of that yet.
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 22:35:17 - Jesse Y: Which data are you looking for?
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 22:57:08 - @memm:blender.org: Verts, edges, faces and UVs.
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 22:57:37 - @memm:blender.org: Like the kind of data you get from exporting a mesh. Normals and so on.
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 23:00:36 - @memm:blender.org: But python is too slow for this. So I'm looking into as_pointer() usage.
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 23:03:33 - @memm:blender.org: And because the current way of getting this data with as_pointer is deprecated on the C side, I'm wondering how long it'll remain available.
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 23:12:57 - Jesse Y: That should all be present in some form, though normals are more complicated. I have to run since it's late here but a standard cube for example has edge/face indices as well as UV map attributes accordingly:
```
<bpy_struct, FloatVectorAttribute("position") at 0x0000023EE07A6A00>
<bpy_struct, BoolAttribute(".select_vert") at 0x0000023EE07A6A78>
<bpy_struct, Int2Attribute(".edge_verts") at 0x0000023EE07A4E08> # indices that define the edges
<bpy_struct, BoolAttribute(".select_edge") at 0x0000023EE07A4E80>
<bpy_struct, BoolAttribute(".select_poly") at 0x0000023EE07A4B88>
<bpy_struct, BoolAttribute("sharp_face") at 0x0000023EE07A4C00>
<bpy_struct, IntAttribute(".corner_vert") at 0x0000023EE07A4688>  # indices that define the faces
<bpy_struct, IntAttribute(".corner_edge") at 0x0000023EE07A4700>
<bpy_struct, Float2Attribute("UVMap") at 0x0000023EE07A4778>   # UV map data (could be more than one if added etc.)
```

Someone else may be able to help further. Unsure of timelines for complete removal of old api.
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 00:08:31 - Thomas Dinges: Good morning, does anyone know why we have `{fmt}` lib twice? It's in `extern\fmtlib` and also in `versions.cmake`
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 00:21:43 - @aras_p:blender.org: My understanding is that some libraries that we build (OpenImageIO perhaps) need fmt to build themselves. So versions.cmake would be for the "I need to rebuild OIIO or something" case. The one embedded into extern is for when blender code uses fmt directly case.
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 00:23:50 - Thomas Dinges: Thanks, question then is if we could/want to deduplicate this? Maybe a question for Sergey 
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 00:24:38 - Thomas Dinges: But can also mark the one in cmake as Dependency time build only, this way it does not show up in the new license document
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 01:41:44 - @sergey:blender.org: Bart van der Braak: Did you break my ship? The https://projects.blender.org/ doesn't open here
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 01:42:00 - @bartvdbraak:blender.org: Something DNS related
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 01:42:09 - @bartvdbraak:blender.org: I am investigating
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 01:47:55 - @bartvdbraak:blender.org: Sergey:

Our internal DNS resolver is borked.
If I ask Google or Cloudflare directly, it resolves fine:

Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 03:49:10 - @jacqueslucke:blender.org: Oh, didn't notice a conflict when I merged, git didn't mention any merge conflict
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 03:50:02 - Falk David: hm strange.. maybe my git is setup to not try and resolve conflicts it can resolve 😅
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 03:50:54 - Falk David: Do you have some default merge strategy setup?
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 03:52:08 - Falk David: Seems like main is not in a wrong state, so I guess it worked out
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 03:52:27 - @iss:blender.org: But should poke John Kiril Swenson - Please do merge to main when you push to 4.3 next time. See [docs](https://developer.blender.org/docs/handbook/release_process/release_branch/#committing-to-the-stabilizing-branch)
If there are conflicts or you are not sure with the process, poke me or some good samaritan here, so we can assist
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 04:59:20 - @memm:blender.org: For normals it looks like you can do
D.objects['Cube'].data.polygon_normals[0].as_pointer()
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 04:59:50 - @memm:blender.org: Which isn't deprecated.

Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 08:04:59 - John Kiril Swenson: I should've merged it last night... what ended up being the issue?
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 08:08:59 - John Kiril Swenson: Falk David any ideas what went wrong? Maybe I screwed something up since I haven't done this often but just want to know for the future so I can prevent it from happening again :)
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 08:24:58 - Thomas Dinges: 4.2, 4.3 and main have a new way of dealing with licenses/copyright information for third party libraries. This is especially important for platform maintainers and developers who add a new library. Sebastian Parborg Jonas Holzman LazyDodo 

- All libraries have a license and copyright info now (`extern\*\README.blender` and in `versions.cmake`).
- If you update a library version, run `make license` and commit the updated `license.md`
- If you add a new library, please make sure you also add a homepage, license and copyright info.
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 08:27:09 - Thomas Dinges: I will update the docs at https://developer.blender.org/docs/handbook/release_process/release_checklist/third_party_licenses/ but that's for Monday
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 08:32:55 - LazyDodo: Thomas Dinges: i'm not responsible for compliance, I'll allow your stuff in my builder for convenience, but you get to maintain it
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 08:33:53 - Thomas Dinges: You are not. But the person who updates the readme files or versions cmake should run one command, thing gets generated and voila
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 08:34:28 - LazyDodo: you're trying to offload a job you don't like on an unpaid volunteer
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 08:34:38 - LazyDodo: gonna put my foot down here, not happening
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 08:35:07 - Thomas Dinges: You misunderstand me clearly
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 08:35:43 - LazyDodo: you're trying to obfuscate it by phrasing it as "the person who updates versions.cmake" that's me.. 90% of the edits are me
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 08:35:49 - Thomas Dinges: For updated libs (the person who bumps a version in for example `versions.cmake` should run one command `make license`. That's not different than running `make format`
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 08:36:06 - Thomas Dinges: I don't expect you to do a legal check
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 08:36:44 - LazyDodo: you are literally asking that though, "If you add a new library, please make sure you also add a homepage, license and copyright info."
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 08:37:24 - Thomas Dinges: Then I will add the three lines, no worries
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 08:37:25 - Thomas Dinges: Now relax
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 08:37:29 - Thomas Dinges: Message deleted
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 08:38:26 - LazyDodo: Just so you know, i know your situation, not upset with your personally, on the other hand i can very much not let this fly
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 08:38:29 - LazyDodo: take it to your leaders 
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 08:41:27 - Thomas Dinges: You are not adding new libs, isn't this done by devs? I would ask the devs to provide the info. If they don't , no new lib for them
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 08:41:58 - LazyDodo: platform module scripts most of the deps, we're better at it and faster
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 08:42:18 - LazyDodo: once in a while intel or amd will submit ready work there, but it's the exception
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 08:42:35 - LazyDodo: you can't ask harley to go figure out how the deps builder works
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 08:42:58 - LazyDodo: and especially not for platforms he doesn't have
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 08:44:31 - Thomas Dinges: LazyDodo: I am sorry, my brain is toast. You already get infos from devs requesting a new library. The name of the lib, the version etc
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 08:45:02 - Thomas Dinges: From now on you will get a URL, license and copyright info as well. You are not expected to figure things out or do a research
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 08:45:06 - LazyDodo: we should formalize the adding of new libraries, it happens more often and it's pretty much the wild west
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 08:45:25 - Thomas Dinges: All for it
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 08:45:42 - LazyDodo: there's no clear rules and what will and won't be allowed and where it will live (git-lfs /exten, /intern)
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 08:46:16 - LazyDodo: if we were to form some procedure there, incorporating license requirements would be totally possible
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 08:46:17 - Thomas Dinges: The biggest mess is duplication. We have two versions of FMT, 3 of SPIRV-HEADERs and various LLVMS
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 08:46:39 - Thomas Dinges: also 2x LZMA
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 08:47:09 - LazyDodo: won't be de-duplicated though, it's sadly just a fact of life, if intel did their conformance testing on version X, we use X since we don't want to bring any more risk into the system
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 08:47:23 - LazyDodo: if then AMD uses Y for their llvm fork, same story there
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 08:47:52 - LazyDodo: i'd like it for everyone to work in mainline LLVM, but that's not how anyone rolls these days
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 08:49:54 - LazyDodo: how about, i'll come up with some framework in the next couple of weeks/months (unsure, time is scarse) and we run it by you and the admins for approval?
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 08:51:22 - Thomas Dinges: Sure. As said, I will update the docs and can also add what is expected from people who request a new library
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 09:03:39 - Thomas Dinges: For people who are curious, we went from [this labyrinth of text](https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/src/commit/65762c880fcbff57a273bf0fb18a6150d2eef652/release/license/THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES.txt) to this nice [markdown file](https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/src/branch/main/release/license/license.md)

Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 09:14:08 - Bastien Montagne: Falk David: my bet would be that its one of the new workers that Bart van der Braak added?
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 09:14:29 - Falk David: ```

Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 09:16:46 - @bartvdbraak:blender.org: If a new worker keeps failing without resolution I’ll pause it for the time being.
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 09:17:31 - Thomas Dinges: A `GPL-3.0.txt` is indeed not in there
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 09:17:54 - @dfelinto:blender.org: Thomas Dinges: packaging.cmake needs fix
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 09:18:10 - @dfelinto:blender.org: this was that last [ ] on the PR :) the one about making sure things are copied where they are expected
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 09:18:22 - @dfelinto:blender.org: I tried with make release and it worked
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 09:18:28 - @dfelinto:blender.org: I guess I didnt try with make package
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 09:18:31 - @bartvdbraak:blender.org: Not worker-related then? Dalai Felinto 
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 09:18:44 - @dfelinto:blender.org: Bart van der Braak: no, it is code-related, we know how/where to fix it
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 09:18:44 - LazyDodo: i had it but then i pulled ` rename release/license/{GPL-3.0.txt => spdx/GPL-3.0-or-later.txt} (100%)`
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 09:18:46 - Thomas Dinges: Bart van der Braak: No, enyour your bus ride
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 09:19:05 - Thomas Dinges: So guess a rename was forgotten
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 09:19:19 - @bartvdbraak:blender.org: 👌👌
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 09:19:39 - @dfelinto:blender.org: Thomas Dinges: we probably want to (1) set the right path for this license, and (2) include the license.md there?
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 09:19:47 - @dfelinto:blender.org: This is only on windows
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 09:20:00 - @dfelinto:blender.org: on Mac it just copies the entire content of the licenses folder to the Resources sub-folder
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 09:20:07 - LazyDodo: it's being displayed in the installer, you want that to be _just_ gplv3

Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 10:11:04 - Hans Goudey: I'd start looking in `mesh.cc`

Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 12:57:38 - mushroomeo: guys i wanted talk about one super annoying little thing, in blender if you rotate object then you have to rotate aropund the object, its was good before we had the feature to press B and lock on some vertec to use it as direction that was recently added that super feature, but now its no more needed, and so we need a option to disable it and only allow rotating idf you move the mouse to left or right,because its very annoying frustrating that always see in what direction you move the mouse...
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 12:58:20 - mushroomeo: i mean if you press the R button 2 times for rotating around it makes sense but if pressing 1 time R it doesnt make sense anymore
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 12:58:44 - mushroomeo: and so so many times tye users need to zoom out to rotate normaly...
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 12:59:49 - Hans Goudey: weizhen Pushed a fix, sorry about that!
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 13:01:25 - mushroomeo: i mean the other softwares dont need to spin the muse cursor aorund objects like crazy only to change direction of object or not?

Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 15:00:20 - SensArice: Our company has developed numerous tools using dirent to facilitate the exchange of formats between different software. These tools convert scenes into folders and perform batch imports, which have then been integrated as plugins for various software applications. This has led me to consider that the "string" node section in Blender's Geometry Nodes might benefit from features such as "search folder," "split by line," and "count lines." I will be attempting to create these nodes next. Perhaps we can enable Blender users to create their own folder parsers and batch I/O tools using Geometry Nodes.

Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 18:58:58 - SensArice: If each added node needs an enumeration, then does the order in which they are arranged matter?

There is a line of code in lightprobe_vert.glsl:vert_iface.face = gl_InstanceID;I don’t understand the function of this geometry shader, and why the built-in variable gl_InstanceID is called here.

Sat, Oct 19, 2024, 06:45:29 - SensArice: Iliya Katushenock: I currently believe that storing string properties is a rather imprudent practice, as it doesn’t prevent someone from storing an entire document on a vertex. Therefore, I think adding '*' and '&' nodes to Geometry Nodes might be more practical.
Sat, Oct 19, 2024, 15:20:09 - SensArice: Storing an enum and an array at a vertex doesn't seem too difficult, what puzzles me is how to make the pointers point to the correct addresses when the file is reopened.

Sun, Oct 20, 2024, 07:21:13 - @vyach:blender.org: The issue is libraries have different (not default) names
Sun, Oct 20, 2024, 07:26:08 - LazyDodo: what's not default about them?
Sun, Oct 20, 2024, 07:26:29 - LazyDodo: they come like this straight out of our ffmpeg build, we don't do any renames or anything
Sun, Oct 20, 2024, 07:28:58 - LazyDodo: also just dropping in new dll's won't make it faster, will require some changes on the blender side of things to make it actually use the faster encoders
Sun, Oct 20, 2024, 07:29:13 - @aras_p:blender.org: Vyach: even if you replaced ffmpeg libraries used by blender, you'd still "somehow" would need for blender to tell ffmpeg to use nvenc encoder. Looking into hardware video encoding/decoding (via ffmpeg nvenc or other means) is "in the plans", but not sure when exactly we'll do it.
Sun, Oct 20, 2024, 07:55:26 - SensArice: Our company is promoting a 3D modeling software primarily using the OSG file format, which is mainly used for processing terrain data scanned by drones. It can be applied in areas such as mine exploration and game scene creation. I would like to ask if there are any Blender developers who would be willing to create import/export functions for OSG files in Blender.
Sun, Oct 20, 2024, 07:56:12 - SensArice: https://openscenegraph.github.io/openscenegraph.io/
Sun, Oct 20, 2024, 09:40:48 - @vyach:blender.org: So it sounds like «the only proper way — is to make separate Blender build», right?
But I hope nvenc option will appear someday. Amateur video editing is really nice and fast with Blender (idk about professional). I shifted from Shotcut. It was nice too, but with 30min+ stripes and multiple cuts it stutters a lot.

Thanks for reply.
Sun, Oct 20, 2024, 09:43:17 - LazyDodo: it's not just rebuilding with the right flags, the code for blender to use nvenc or any other gpu based enoder is missing someone has to sit down and write it
Sun, Oct 20, 2024, 11:38:11 - @aras_p:blender.org: Vyach meanwhile, even if it is not nvenc, you can try updating to more recent blender versions. All of these: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3 (beta), 4.4 (alpha) had video related performance improvements compared to previous versions. Not hardware acceleration, but still speedups.

Mon, Oct 21, 2024, 00:28:54 - SensArice: If I need to modify Blender's BKE to create a void or mach, which I will subsequently develop into "VFX compositing nodes," "geometry nodes," and "shader nodes," which module would this fall under?
Mon, Oct 21, 2024, 00:49:08 - @dfelinto:blender.org: Hey Bart van der Braak , has anyone poked you about corrupted [blender_manual_epub.zip](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/dev/blender_manual_epub.zip) and [blender_manual_html.zip](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/dev/blender_manual_html.zip). I couldn't make much sense of the [errors](https://builder.blender.org/admin/#/builders/12/builds/2003), but just clicked "Re-build" to see if it magically goes away
Mon, Oct 21, 2024, 00:49:25 - @dfelinto:blender.org: I'm poking you since you asked to keep an eye on the new bbot machines, right?
Mon, Oct 21, 2024, 01:17:08 - @sergey:blender.org: Thomas Dinges: Hey. We kinda skipped dev kickoff today. It is all about bcon for us this week (packing, moving, unpacking, setitng up, etc). Not sure if anyone from us joins the online part, so just a heads-up!

Mon, Oct 21, 2024, 01:24:42 - @dfelinto:blender.org: I have the broken .zips locally in case the re-build replaces them and someone wants to do some forensics
Mon, Oct 21, 2024, 01:29:42 - @dfelinto:blender.org: I haven't done a valgrind build in a long, long while. Is it just a matter of enabling "WITH_MEM_VALGRIND" on ccmake? or do I also need to turn off ASAN?

 I did a build here (Linux) to investigate a crash, but it is rendering way too fast for a valgrind debug build, so I suspect maybe it is missing something.
Mon, Oct 21, 2024, 01:46:15 - @dfelinto:blender.org: deheck ... rebuild has no errors, yet the .zips are still bogus

But would add comment to this explaining why it needs to store size in temp variable? Otherwise one of our future selves will likely remove this 'useless extra line' 😉

Tue, Oct 22, 2024, 11:35:40 - LazyDodo: it's pretty quiet today, so it don't really matter, if it were busier i'd suggest using #blender-builds:blender.org though, what's up?
Tue, Oct 22, 2024, 11:39:10 - Lucas Mellone: Let me check again. Trying to see if the Debug build will at least work.
Tue, Oct 22, 2024, 11:52:25 - Lucas Mellone: So yeah, both builds are having the same error.

Tue, Oct 22, 2024, 13:04:34 - Lucas Mellone: Yes, all runs well with VS. 
Probably it's an issue within JetBrains Rider.

If I want to create a string filter that can handle multiple keywords, would it be the optimal solution to allocate threads based on the number of keywords? Their function is to find lines that meet the criteria in a 10,000 characters long document.
Fri, Oct 25, 2024, 19:53:10 - SensArice: I believe that adding more nodes related to "string filtering" could allow users more possibilities to "use enumeration" within the node, thereby replacing some of the methods that involve "storing characters in geometry and using a lot of memory."

Sat, Oct 26, 2024, 08:06:15 - @adv_sw:blender.org: Guys, does anyone know where the algorithm the shader editor Hue/Saturation/Value Hue rotate lives, please. I want to check exactly what it's doing.
Sat, Oct 26, 2024, 08:15:53 - @adv_sw:blender.org: couple of things with it. 

1. identity, I'd expect a hue rotate of 0. turns out that node is on identity at 0.5

2nd, seems it rejects hue rotate if saturation is below 0.4 or something like that which is nice but would expect that to be tweakable.
Sat, Oct 26, 2024, 08:19:00 - @adv_sw:blender.org: 3rd, I'd like to figure out what color space the hue rotate is occuring in.
Sat, Oct 26, 2024, 08:19:59 - @adv_sw:blender.org: as of blender 4.2 - things may have changed.
Sat, Oct 26, 2024, 08:24:38 - @adv_sw:blender.org: hmmm, is just a straight rgb->hsv [tweak]->rgb apparently.
Sat, Oct 26, 2024, 08:25:19 - Raiko: adv_sw: 1.) For Cycles it's this file: https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/src/branch/main/intern/cycles/kernel/svm/hsv.h
2.) I don't think it rejects it. On the 4.4 main branch it works just fine. It's possible that you're not seeing a noticeable difference due to the low saturation.
3.) It just does some modifications to the HSV values. And regarding 4.2 the Git history doesn't indicate any changes in functionality.
Sat, Oct 26, 2024, 08:27:05 - @adv_sw:blender.org: thanks for looking that up for me yeah, I'm getting good results without that saturation filter too now, apparently I messed it up somehow my first attempt, though that's a nice feature to have. lets you keep the 'base' the same & just tweak the dominant colors.
Sat, Oct 26, 2024, 08:32:22 - @adv_sw:blender.org: issue resolved. I think, had an error causing me to overthink this. 
Sat, Oct 26, 2024, 08:35:07 - @adv_sw:blender.org: whilst I'm here, a little back. this apparently better than hsv : https://bottosson.github.io/posts/oklab/

whether its practically worth it or not, haven't decided yet.
Sat, Oct 26, 2024, 09:06:41 - @adv_sw:blender.org: & I'm advised should look at this for high dynamic range. not today, but you guys might be interested or already have support.

Sat, Oct 26, 2024, 10:06:42 - LazyDodo: not that i'm aware of, should be good up to 1024 threads, what's the output of [core info](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/coreinfo) on that box?
Sat, Oct 26, 2024, 10:10:27 - LazyDodo: also when you do a different workload, ie render with cycles, does it run into the same 32 core limit?
Sat, Oct 26, 2024, 10:17:01 - @adv_sw:blender.org: <@mod:blender.org "You probably can send this as a ..."> the hue rotation at 0.5 identity instead of expected 0 ?  that's a gui clundge imo, fix the offset how you want in the gui  -1  0  1  or whatever. or proposed possible enhancements ?
Sat, Oct 26, 2024, 10:20:16 - Iliya Katushenock: adv_sw: https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/src/branch/main/source/blender/blenlib/intern/math_color.cc#L234-L256
Sat, Oct 26, 2024, 10:23:49 - @adv_sw:blender.org: bug in my view is function does not interpret hue rotate of 0 equating normally to 0 degrees to identity (no) hue change.
instead there is an arbitrary 0.5

hues in current scene format will need to be remapped accordingly. user invisible.

will look different from script though.
Sat, Oct 26, 2024, 10:24:51 - @adv_sw:blender.org: or you guys are just we don't care, that's how we do it. perhaps valid.

Sat, Oct 26, 2024, 18:53:45 - Alaska: toromail.csudh.edu: Please don't post your question in multiple channels.

To install Blender on macOS (What I assume you're using based on your other messages) you need too:
- Download Blender, preferably from the Blender website: https://www.blender.org/download
- Open the dmg that was downloaded
- Then drag and drop the Blender app into your application folder.

For future questions related to installing Blender, I'd recommend using a community support site rather than a developer channel. Some of these sites can be found here: https://www.blender.org/community/

Sun, Oct 27, 2024, 04:33:54 - Falk David: Don't think you'll find a tutorial on it.
Sun, Oct 27, 2024, 04:35:08 - Falk David: It's mostly a matter of getting all the dependencies to build I think.

Sun, Oct 27, 2024, 12:03:58 - @vkoskiv:blender.org: How can I get notified in my `bpy.types.RenderEngine` subclass when the user exits shaded viewport mode? Docs say `__del__()` gets called, but Blender doesn't call this when exiting shaded viewport mode, and just calls `__init__()` on a new instance when re-entering it. So it leaves old instances of my renderer laying around, which causes a bunch of problems.
Sun, Oct 27, 2024, 12:07:40 - @vkoskiv:blender.org: It's been a few months and I think I've looked at the docs quite thoroughly, but I still have a million questions. I keep littering my python plugin with comments expressing confusion about various things. I kind of left my plugin in an unfinished state, because it became a bit exhausting just slapping in hacky fixes because I couldn't work out what the proper approach is, and this is just a hobby project to get my renderer to work with Blender.
Sun, Oct 27, 2024, 12:08:48 - @vkoskiv:blender.org: I got it to ~80% working state, but that last 20% did eventually wear me down 😅
Sun, Oct 27, 2024, 12:12:07 - @vkoskiv:blender.org: This isn't a criticism of Blender, to be clear, I just never managed to fully wrap my brain around the Blender API and the 'proper' way to develop Blender plugins. (I just have a target in my Makefile that copies all the plugin files to the correct directory, and most of the time, I have to restart Blender, it doesn't pick up my changes otherwise.)
Sun, Oct 27, 2024, 12:13:04 - @vkoskiv:blender.org: My renderer ends up as a `.so` that my Python wrapper then includes, and I suspect that changes to that file specifically may cause Blender to crash, if I try to 'hot reload' my plugin.

Sun, Oct 27, 2024, 20:15:59 - LazyDodo: Francesco Siddi: just watched blender by the numbers, the reason there are an substantial amount of msi installer downloads isn't because people prefer it, it's because _we_ serve it by default on blender.org, the zip version is hidden behind a "MacOS, Linux and other versions" button that doesn't appeal at all to any windows users to click on to discover it, i'm convinced user preference isn't at play at all there, if we were to switch to .zip by default that be the majority of our downloads

I’m reaching out regarding the ["D4786: Proportional Editing Vertex Gradient"](https://archive.blender.org/developer/D4786).
I’d like to confirm whether the team still **considers this feature desirable** for an integration into main (for users it represents a significant GUI improvement for proportional editing).

**If** there is still interest, could you advise me on which module owner to contact to discuss the supervision of this merge? I wish to fund the original developer (or another suitable developer) to help complete and integrate this feature into Blender.

Thank you very much for your time and consideration!

Best regards,
Dorian

Mon, Oct 28, 2024, 08:36:16 - sentharn: Blender occasionally gets into a weird state after too many CTDs where it won't open, and on debugging I found this...removing the tablet driver and monitor made it work again. Very strange. Is it normal for blender to start like this? I would expect it to use my primary monitor.
Mon, Oct 28, 2024, 08:36:44 - sentharn: Unfortunately I haven't gotten it to get into the no-start state again. oh you're missing the other screenshot. one sec

Mon, Oct 28, 2024, 08:37:23 - sentharn: Spoiler alert: the Huion tablet was not connected. Not sure if this should be a bug report or if it's normal behavior for Windows' windowing system.
Mon, Oct 28, 2024, 08:37:34 - LazyDodo: that's wintab for you, some of the tablet vendors have shockingly bad drivers
Mon, Oct 28, 2024, 08:37:46 - sentharn: this might surprise you but huion does in fact have terrible drivers
Mon, Oct 28, 2024, 08:38:52 - LazyDodo: you could try switching the tablet api over to force windows ink if that works for your vendor
Mon, Oct 28, 2024, 08:39:16 - sentharn: *oh*. This is tablet specific? Not display specific?
Mon, Oct 28, 2024, 08:39:51 - sentharn: It was late and I could not figure out what this file was doing. This would explain why I have had this issue for like a year and no other Arc users do haha
Mon, Oct 28, 2024, 08:40:11 - sentharn: I just chalked it up to Intel drivers not cleaning up after themselves after an app crash after enough times.
Mon, Oct 28, 2024, 08:40:23 - LazyDodo: think wacom came up with it, and then other vendors just started shipping their own dll to make existing software that had wacom support work with their tablets
Mon, Oct 28, 2024, 08:40:29 - LazyDodo: there's no QA anywhere in that pipeline
Mon, Oct 28, 2024, 08:41:27 - LazyDodo: so wintabl.dll really doesn't mean anything, could be a professionally written piece of software, could be something someones nephew wrote in an afternoon depending on the tablet you have installed
Mon, Oct 28, 2024, 08:42:36 - sentharn: is there any way whatever is going wrong can be caught on the blender side to avoid silent crashes on startup? this is probably a highly specific configuration bug though (arc + huion tablet). I don't even know what operation is dying 
Mon, Oct 28, 2024, 08:43:21 - LazyDodo: we're really just loading some mystery code into our process and rolling them dice
Mon, Oct 28, 2024, 08:43:40 - sentharn: i don't know how you'd document to tell people to try uninstalling their tablet drivers if blender just opens and immediately dies (no full window, just the console window) as a troubleshooting step. 
Mon, Oct 28, 2024, 08:43:42 - LazyDodo: if it crashes, switch over to windows ink, it _tends_ to be better (as there's actual specs and certification tetss)
Mon, Oct 28, 2024, 08:44:10 - sentharn: maybe for windows bug reporting, or the report bug info link, it might be useful to grab tablet info for windows? or is that too niche.
Mon, Oct 28, 2024, 08:44:36 - LazyDodo: think we tried catching the errors in the past, but unsuccessfully  
Mon, Oct 28, 2024, 08:44:54 - sentharn: i've never seen anyone on the issue tracker even ask about tablets. i don't think (?) that a factory startup will get around this either?
Mon, Oct 28, 2024, 08:45:56 - sentharn: I will have to try and get it to crash again I guess. Not too hard. currently hitting Simplify a few times in Cycles viewport preview will reliably crash Blender with my Arc GPU :( haven't put together a repro case yet for the bug tracker
Mon, Oct 28, 2024, 08:45:59 - LazyDodo: just searching for wintab gives you 150+ tickets on the tracker
Mon, Oct 28, 2024, 08:46:12 - sentharn: hahahahahaha
Mon, Oct 28, 2024, 08:47:21 - LazyDodo: even if you have a repro, it be unlikely something we can fix from the blender side, as 99.99% of the time it's some external code doing "the dumb"
Mon, Oct 28, 2024, 08:48:29 - LazyDodo: and to make things more joyful, even if you find out what upsets _your_ wintab driver, and we go, well fine, lets just not do that thing then, you usually break some other vendors stuff 🙂

Mon, Oct 28, 2024, 08:50:14 - LazyDodo: it be a very specific combination, it be wintab drivers from vendor X, version Y, in combination with some other vector
Mon, Oct 28, 2024, 08:51:01 - sentharn: oh hey, he's using Huion too.
Mon, Oct 28, 2024, 08:52:32 - sentharn: Making Blender repeatedly crash seems to make the problem appear...I wonder if the driver is holding onto some reference(s) to Blender that sometimes don't get cleared in time. either way, sounds like a driver issue. book 'em, danno
Mon, Oct 28, 2024, 08:53:03 - LazyDodo: wintab is lawless hellscape that should be shot in the face 🙂 
Mon, Oct 28, 2024, 08:53:28 - sentharn: agreed, fortunately i don't use the tablet much, the shocker is that it was crashing *without the tablet connected*
Mon, Oct 28, 2024, 08:53:49 - sentharn: anything i can contribute to that bug report besides a "yep me too lol"? sounds like it's on Huion to fix.
Mon, Oct 28, 2024, 08:53:58 - LazyDodo: the shocker the bug is in a codepath the vendor is least likely to test?
Mon, Oct 28, 2024, 08:54:12 - sentharn: i am whelmed 
Mon, Oct 28, 2024, 08:54:39 - LazyDodo: you need more time exposed to things like this, you'll be jaded and bitter in notime! 🙂 
Mon, Oct 28, 2024, 08:55:09 - sentharn: its ok i work on software as a dayjob, my shovel is already in my hand
Mon, Oct 28, 2024, 08:55:56 - sentharn: not knowing how tablet drivers worked though made it a little surprising. i would've assumed the tablet driver wouldn't be loaded when the tablet wasn't connected. maybe it's one of those new wireless tablets ;)
Mon, Oct 28, 2024, 08:56:11 - sentharn: (it is not, it has entirely too many wires, as a matter of fact)
Mon, Oct 28, 2024, 08:56:20 - LazyDodo: there's no way to tell
Mon, Oct 28, 2024, 08:56:32 - LazyDodo: so we try to load wintab.dll ask it if there's a tablet
Mon, Oct 28, 2024, 08:56:35 - LazyDodo: and use it if there is
Mon, Oct 28, 2024, 08:57:50 - sentharn: got it. well. i'll probably hook it up again and wait for it to crash to see if there's any more info i can glean. someone asked about display dpi scaling in that bug report and i don't remember what my settings were.

Mon, Oct 28, 2024, 09:00:38 - LazyDodo: same happens with opengl drivers really and vulkan, thing is nvidia has a better QA department than most tablet vendors
Mon, Oct 28, 2024, 09:02:55 - sentharn: the huion driver is great, sometimes it just refuses to acknowledge that the tablet is connected and gives you a windows-10 bsod esque sad face with no further addition
Mon, Oct 28, 2024, 09:03:29 - sentharn: it usually takes a blood sacrifice and an incantation in a forbidden language like Latin or Postscript to get it working again.
Mon, Oct 28, 2024, 09:10:29 - sentharn: https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/issues/127916 might as well look at this while i have the debugger up
Mon, Oct 28, 2024, 09:11:27 - LazyDodo: i see 2 intel guys in that ticket, pretty sure they'll figure it out
Mon, Oct 28, 2024, 09:12:08 - LazyDodo: that being said, someone that can actually use a debugger will certainly help
Mon, Oct 28, 2024, 09:12:09 - sentharn: i've had an okish track record of finding new repro cases for them over the past year or so as an arc daily driver
Mon, Oct 28, 2024, 09:12:20 - sentharn: it usually ends up with "hey this scene crashes, good luck" though
Mon, Oct 28, 2024, 09:13:06 - sentharn: wow, that's weird. it was denoising fine then i accidentally hit lookdev and on switching back, it's taking forever. i wonder if that's consistent. vram exhaustion?
Mon, Oct 28, 2024, 09:14:15 - sentharn sent an image. (Media omitted)
Mon, Oct 28, 2024, 09:14:22 - sentharn: the original bugreporter has half the VRAM I do
Mon, Oct 28, 2024, 09:14:28 - sentharn: im going to guess it might be a memory issue
Mon, Oct 28, 2024, 09:15:42 - sentharn: actual question: does blender ever let go of textures etc loaded as part of lookdev and if so how long does it take?
Mon, Oct 28, 2024, 09:16:58 - LazyDodo: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Mon, Oct 28, 2024, 09:17:12 - LazyDodo: that's way out of my comfort zone, you'll need one of the smarter devs for that
Mon, Oct 28, 2024, 09:17:31 - sentharn sent an image. (Media omitted)
Mon, Oct 28, 2024, 09:17:36 - sentharn sent an image. (Media omitted)
Mon, Oct 28, 2024, 09:17:45 - sentharn: it still has not released the memory, i'm back on solid view
Mon, Oct 28, 2024, 09:18:05 - sentharn: reloading the scene makes it go away at least.
Mon, Oct 28, 2024, 09:18:26 - sentharn: that would explain some of my own perf issues...i switch between lookdev and viewport preview a lot...i wonder if nvidia does it...time to go test on that machine
Mon, Oct 28, 2024, 09:19:15 - @weizhen:blender.org: Somehow I keep getting weird crashes on main recently? It's different message each time and the behaviour is non-deterministic so I don't know where to start.
Mon, Oct 28, 2024, 09:19:36 - @weizhen:blender.org: Examples are:
```

Mon, Oct 28, 2024, 09:57:35 - Nika Kutsniashvili: About windows installer thing, main reason for doing it is that windows then recognizes it as app and it shows up in searchs and UI everywhere
Mon, Oct 28, 2024, 10:00:27 - LazyDodo: perhaps, when you make the choice to deliberately use the installer or zip, most users will just smash that download button and take whatever we give them
Mon, Oct 28, 2024, 10:03:10 - Nika Kutsniashvili: I think if zip becomes default we're looking at either complaints or confused bug reports about Blender not showing up when you search in taskbar and etc.
Mon, Oct 28, 2024, 10:05:23 - LazyDodo: I'm not suggesting to change it, i am howerver rejecting Francesco Siddi 's point of users _choosing_ the installer rather them just taking what we give them

Mon, Oct 28, 2024, 20:37:07 - Alaska: zouali1: Please do not post the same question to multiple channels. Many of the same people visit the same channels.

As for what it should do, my expectation would be that it resets the selected value to a reasonable default for the operator that you just ran.

Tue, Oct 29, 2024, 02:48:50 - @sergey:blender.org: Thomas Dinges: Seems we have plenty of branches which technically should in the forks, with PR created from them.
Time for a PA to remind people about it?

Tue, Oct 29, 2024, 03:18:45 - @sergey:blender.org: The buildbot uses Python 3.9, but it is from a special venv. The way how typical build environment is provisioned (using `linux_rocky8_setup.py`)  uses Python 3.6.8.

Tue, Oct 29, 2024, 06:41:05 - Jonas Holzman: Sergey: It _seems_ like Gitea doesn't support retargeting a PR branch without making an even bigger mess, so I'll just wait for [this PR](https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/pulls/128961) to be fully approved and will then delete the branch, also took steps to make sure I don't accidentally push branches to the wrong remote again.

Tue, Oct 29, 2024, 07:02:07 - @fclem:blender.org: Also a birdy told me that we might switch to clang on windows in the near future
Tue, Oct 29, 2024, 07:05:13 - LazyDodo: that birdy may have misunderstood, i've only committed to running clang _next_ to our regular msvc builds
Tue, Oct 29, 2024, 07:05:53 - LazyDodo: it won't replace msvc just yet
Tue, Oct 29, 2024, 07:21:22 - @anthony-roberts:blender.org: Switch Windows x64, that is ;) Windows ARM64 has been building with clang for nearly 2 months now
Tue, Oct 29, 2024, 07:44:05 - @pragma37:blender.org: I'm thinking about implementing some of the features for the npr-prototype as node group assets instead of hard-coded nodes, so it's easier for users to tinker with them and make modifications.
Are there any special steps required for adding new assets other than dropping the blend files inside the `blender-assets` repo?
I would have to make a new `npr-prototype` branch in the `blender-assets` repo, but other than that is there any problem in taking that route?
Any gotcha I should be aware of?
Tue, Oct 29, 2024, 08:08:13 - Bastien Montagne: Recent Compositor and VSE unittests are horribly slow now on main debug + ASAN builds... Talking about 700 to 900 seconds for a lot of these.
This was not the case a week ago or so.
This is not really good, since release ones are not that bad (30 to 50 seconds), it would seem that some things like heavy asserts and/or asserts in low-level loops have been added recently?
CC Aras Pranckevičius Sebastian Parborg iss zazizizou 
Tue, Oct 29, 2024, 08:10:25 - @zeddb:blender.org: I haven't had time to work on the VSE recently so on my end I haven't added anything (and I'm not aware of anything that was added either)

Tue, Oct 29, 2024, 11:06:11 - Iliya Katushenock: Bastien Montagne: Now CPU compositor use MultiFunctions + CPP BLI vectors, everythings is the best things for debuging, each step is covered bu at least one assertion
Tue, Oct 29, 2024, 11:07:03 - Iliya Katushenock: Do you seen *recent* discusion about how debug image processing becoms slow with CPP Vector math?

Tue, Oct 29, 2024, 11:12:39 - Iliya Katushenock: Have no idea how Compositor and VSE are covered by the same tests\\
Tue, Oct 29, 2024, 11:15:23 - LazyDodo: think both are done by idiff, so must go though the image output pipeline, perhaps something changed there?
Tue, Oct 29, 2024, 11:27:29 - @aras_p:blender.org: Iliya Katushenock: they are not covered by the same tests. What Bastien is saying, is that both compositor and VSE tests got slower (in debug+asan config). Due to, uhh, something. So far no one knows what. Someone should bisect :)
Tue, Oct 29, 2024, 11:36:57 - Bastien Montagne: I will bisect tomorrow yes 🙂

Tue, Oct 29, 2024, 14:22:34 - @sean-kim:blender.org: Is there a good reason to not add a debug assert in `rna_access.cc` on the `RNA_*_get`/ `RNA_*_set` methods when we're unable to find a particular identifier? It seems like this would allow catching a class of errors faster instead of needing to see the `printf` "... not found." output in the terminal.
Tue, Oct 29, 2024, 15:14:16 - @iss:blender.org: Bastien Montagne: I have run the tests on recent main, and did not see any comp/VSE test with time > 10s.
Tue, Oct 29, 2024, 15:18:34 - LazyDodo: same i had an asan build from the 24th and just tried latest main, times are more or less equal ~15s for `compositor_color_cpu`
Tue, Oct 29, 2024, 15:31:17 - @zazizizou:blender.org: Test `gpu` is failing on buildbot. Clément Foucault maybe related to commit `Fix: Metal: Remove some more shader compilation warnings` ? 
Tue, Oct 29, 2024, 15:32:29 - LazyDodo: turning a warn into an error technically removed the warn 🙂 
Tue, Oct 29, 2024, 15:36:21 - @fclem:blender.org: 😩
Tue, Oct 29, 2024, 15:39:11 - @fclem:blender.org: Facking hell the tests pass for me
Tue, Oct 29, 2024, 15:39:17 - @fclem:blender.org: better revert
Tue, Oct 29, 2024, 15:40:08 - @fclem:blender.org: Ah wait
Tue, Oct 29, 2024, 15:40:23 - @fclem:blender.org: its only about atomic buffers
Tue, Oct 29, 2024, 15:42:05 - @fclem:blender.org: It's the workaround tests!
Tue, Oct 29, 2024, 15:52:25 - @fclem:blender.org: I see, the bot is not yet on MacOS 14.0+
Tue, Oct 29, 2024, 15:55:42 - @fclem:blender.org: Fixed!
Tue, Oct 29, 2024, 15:57:39 - @fclem:blender.org: Would be nice to see the bot check both versions. Seems weird that the normal path is not tested on the build bot and the workaround not enforced in `GPUMetalWorkaroundsTest`.
Tue, Oct 29, 2024, 16:18:57 - LazyDodo: no idea if that's possible or not, maybe Jonas Holzman can take a peek?
Tue, Oct 29, 2024, 16:42:02 - Jonas Holzman: will check tomorrow
Tue, Oct 29, 2024, 16:45:19 - @fclem:blender.org: Basically this part should be triggered by our `--debug-gpu-workaround`
```

Wed, Oct 30, 2024, 04:26:56 - @vyach:blender.org: Hello developers. I have strange blender crashes. May be you have meet such sutiation and can help.
1. Debug log contains only one error «FT_Stream_Open: could not open `C:\Windows\Fonts\'
» but blender always start properly with this error.
2. Crashes for all blender versiosns together and xnView (picture browser). Once one crash, I can`t run another. So I suppose issue with drivers
3. Issue can be healed only with reloading OS (windows)
4. Crash usually caused by «overload»: when I try to generate 120M+ triangles with Geometry nodes
5. Web3D (sketchfab) or 3D games run properly, so, perhaps, it is not 3d-drivers

I understand, that it may be not direct blender issue. But still related. As you can see, there is no good infor for making proper report…
Any ideas?

Wed, Oct 30, 2024, 04:29:23 - @vyach:blender.org: Additional: Somehow it blender run again. After restarting OBS and laucnhing Baldurs gate 3… Looks like component was crashed and reloaded again…
Then I started b4.2 and situation repeats…
Wed, Oct 30, 2024, 05:44:45 - Bastien Montagne: So turns out the issue was in my CMake settings, somehow the `WITH_TESTS_BATCHED` got disabled... 😵‍💫
Still find it weird that this can make a test 20 times slower (`sequencer_render_blend_modes_byte` is 10s/200s with/without that build option). 
Wed, Oct 30, 2024, 07:02:59 - Thomas Dinges: It seems there are some older and new branches in the main repository, that should not be in there (anymore)? A friendly reminder about our workflow, which is
1) Fork the repository
2) Commit branches to your fork
3) Create a pull request from your fork/branch
Wed, Oct 30, 2024, 07:05:22 - LazyDodo: Thomas Dinges: the number of branches that should live in the main repo is gonna be _very_ limited (but there are legitimate reasons to have one) and rare, maybe its better to just prevent devs from pushing new branches, if someone really needs a branch an admin can make one for them
Wed, Oct 30, 2024, 07:08:21 - Thomas Dinges: What is the status of these? (Apologies if I ping the wrong person, not sure who created all these)

Wed, Oct 30, 2024, 07:10:56 - Thomas Dinges: LazyDodo: Good idea, indeed there are only very little reasons this should be done, and in legitimate cases someone from admins or I can just create one
Wed, Oct 30, 2024, 07:13:14 - LazyDodo: Thomas Dinges: that way you also have a record as of _why_ a branch exists, plus you get to enforce some kind of naming scheme
Wed, Oct 30, 2024, 07:13:15 - @lukastonne:blender.org: `realtime-clock` has a copy on my fork, will remove from the main repo
Wed, Oct 30, 2024, 07:23:59 - @howardtrickey:blender.org: Thomas Dinges: the Rob-Blair-main one was a mistake and I will try to delete it.

Wed, Oct 30, 2024, 09:58:02 - Iliya Katushenock: I think everyone faced with this at least once..
Wed, Oct 30, 2024, 10:34:07 - Jesse Y: Thomas Dinges I'll have to get into contact with Michael K. to see if those tmp branches are needed in some way, they're probably not needed.  +1 for just preventing the pushing of new branches like that.
Wed, Oct 30, 2024, 10:56:36 - @matt-mclin:blender.org: I would like to add some logging for debug purposes to the message bus system, to see which objects/keys are being updated.  However, the `wmMsgSubscribeKey` and `wmMsgSubscribeValue` structs don't appear to give a pointer to the key object.  The key has a `ListBase` of values, and each of those has a `void *owner`, is that a pointer to the object?  Could I safely cast that to anything that would provide access to a DNA `ID` with its `name`?

```

```
Thu, Oct 31, 2024, 00:24:54 - Thomas Dinges: Good day! We're less than two weeks away from the 4.3 release. A couple of things:
* There are still some bugs, please prioritize them for 4.3, especially high severity ones
* The release notes could use more example images like
  * Compositor: Multi Pass for EEVEE
  * Cycles: Volume scattering phase functions
  * EEVEE: Light/shadow linking (examples there are Cycles right now)
  * UV: Minimum Stretch
  * Render/Texture: Gabor Noise
Thu, Oct 31, 2024, 00:28:19 - Thomas Dinges: Also I am asking developers to confirm the remaining open tickets in the 4.3 milestone: https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/milestone/21 Everything that is not a bugfix and not planned/important for 4.3 should be removed from the milestone
Thu, Oct 31, 2024, 01:30:38 - @aras_p:blender.org: Do what Thomas says! Otherwise it will end up like this, https://conference.blender.org/media/photos/2024/20241024_BCON_Foto_Jelmer_de_Haas_JDH2213.jpg
Thu, Oct 31, 2024, 01:33:53 - Thomas Dinges: I knew this would pop up at some point! Usually I am waaaay nicer 😅
Thu, Oct 31, 2024, 02:47:49 - @lukastonne:blender.org: how do i create a __new__ brush asset in the current file, instead of making a copy in the asset library file (eek)?
Thu, Oct 31, 2024, 03:07:04 - Hans Goudey: You're meant to always duplicate an existing brush asset basically
Thu, Oct 31, 2024, 03:21:36 - @lukastonne:blender.org: ok, not my area
Thu, Oct 31, 2024, 04:50:40 - @sergey:blender.org: Bastien Montagne: Not sure how much strict we want to be about it, the `GHOST_TaskBarX11` leaks the launcher handle. It's one-off leak per Blender process, so not horrible, just could be noisy. Not sure what is the proper retention policy on that object. Chrome behaves exactly like Blender, Pidgin plugin does explicit g_object_ref/g_object_unref
Thu, Oct 31, 2024, 04:51:02 - @sergey:blender.org: Warning, wall-o-text :)

Thu, Oct 31, 2024, 06:03:46 - @fclem:blender.org: Didn't we used to have a clang-tidy cmake option?
Thu, Oct 31, 2024, 06:04:38 - @fclem:blender.org: Ah its not available on apple
Thu, Oct 31, 2024, 06:04:43 - @fclem:blender.org: any reasons why?
Thu, Oct 31, 2024, 06:06:51 - @fclem:blender.org: i just enabled it and it works
Thu, Oct 31, 2024, 06:16:45 - @sergey:blender.org: i used it on linux, and Jonas Holzman is using it on mac
Thu, Oct 31, 2024, 06:19:47 - @fclem:blender.org: Can we change the CMakeLists.txt to allows enabling on mac then?
Thu, Oct 31, 2024, 06:49:12 - Jonas Holzman: <@fclem:blender.org "Can we change the CMakeLists.txt..."> Ah yeah there's no reason for it to be disabled on mac, I personally don't use it through Blender CMake, but it is indeed working correctly, and I even recently updated our `.clang-tidy` to add Objective-C checks
Thu, Oct 31, 2024, 06:49:58 - @sergey:blender.org: Clément Foucault: Yes we can. But needs testing etc. Because its kinda painful to mix XCode toolchain with something that is installed from homebrew
Thu, Oct 31, 2024, 06:50:08 - Jonas Holzman: Also looking at the CMakeList blame, there doesn't seem to be any direct reason why it was disabled on mac when linux support was added, apart from the fact that it wasn't directly tested on
Thu, Oct 31, 2024, 06:50:12 - @sergey:blender.org: Not even sure homebrew would expose clang in the PATH
Thu, Oct 31, 2024, 06:50:32 - Jonas Holzman: <@sergey:blender.org "Clément Foucault: Yes we can. Bu..."> Can't we obtain it from the pre-compiled LLVM libs?
Thu, Oct 31, 2024, 06:51:02 - @sergey:blender.org: Now we probably can. We didn't have it back in the days
Thu, Oct 31, 2024, 06:51:04 - Jonas Holzman: I believed ankitm mentioned it was bundled not so long ago
Thu, Oct 31, 2024, 06:51:23 - Jonas Holzman: <@sergey:blender.org "Now we probably can. We didn't h..."> Right, I'll check tomorrow
Thu, Oct 31, 2024, 06:51:33 - Jonas Holzman: And if everything works well, I'll make a pr for it
Thu, Oct 31, 2024, 06:52:02 - @sergey:blender.org: I am not sure how old it is, and whether it's easy yo run, or whether it'll require some DYLIB_LIBRARY_PATH magic
Thu, Oct 31, 2024, 06:52:06 - LazyDodo: it's bundled in mac, not on linux/windows (but then again windows support is dicy to start with)
Thu, Oct 31, 2024, 06:52:35 - @fclem:blender.org: I forgot, is there a way to enable it selectively on a folder?
Thu, Oct 31, 2024, 06:53:11 - LazyDodo: Sergey: we run clang-format from the same build, it'll "likely" (yeahh.. that's gonna turn around and bite me in the rear) be ok
Thu, Oct 31, 2024, 06:53:26 - @sergey:blender.org: Move the CMAKE_C_LANG_TIDY and CXX_LANG_TIDY to that directory
Thu, Oct 31, 2024, 06:53:47 - Jonas Holzman: <@fclem:blender.org "I forgot, is there a way to enab..."> iirc the cli experience is not that great
Thu, Oct 31, 2024, 06:54:10 - @sergey:blender.org: Clément Foucault: enable globally, fix all teh shait from others
Thu, Oct 31, 2024, 06:54:12 - Jonas Holzman: I personally have it embedded in my IDE for inline checks/suggestions
Thu, Oct 31, 2024, 06:54:15 - @sergey:blender.org: Clément Foucault: and wleocme to my world ;)
Thu, Oct 31, 2024, 06:54:43 - @sergey:blender.org: Clément Foucault: and embrace the world outside of `draw/` and `gpu/` ! ;)
Thu, Oct 31, 2024, 06:55:48 - LazyDodo: i'm not sure rest of the codebase could sustain that amount of chaos 🙂 
Thu, Oct 31, 2024, 07:00:29 - @sergey:blender.org: I thought Hans and Jacques were using clang-tidy, so didn't expect chaos
Thu, Oct 31, 2024, 07:02:11 - LazyDodo: i meant more unleashing clement outside draw/ and gpu/
Thu, Oct 31, 2024, 07:03:15 - @fclem:blender.org: 😤
Thu, Oct 31, 2024, 07:14:04 - @fclem:blender.org: Jonas Holzman:  what extension do you use?
Thu, Oct 31, 2024, 07:30:13 - Jonas Holzman: <@fclem:blender.org "Jonas Holzman:  what extension d..."> I'm kind of cheating, I use CLion, which has clang-tidy support built-in
Thu, Oct 31, 2024, 07:30:46 - Jonas Holzman: I belieeeve VSCode has kind of a similar thing bundled in its default C++ extension from the last time I used it
Thu, Oct 31, 2024, 08:06:41 - @sergey:blender.org: Ok folks. Please remember that release branch is to be merged to `main` as soon as you land things in there!
Thu, Oct 31, 2024, 08:07:03 - @sergey:blender.org: Every time I was merging 4.3 to main today there was someone's else commit from a while ago merged as well
Thu, Oct 31, 2024, 08:11:33 - @fclem:blender.org: I stopped using the MSVC C++ extension. It is too slow and buggy. I am now using `clangd` extension and it works like a charm, except for objective-C headers 😩
Thu, Oct 31, 2024, 09:00:37 - Julian Eisel: Is anyone here compiling blender with xcode & on Intel? (following the usual instructions: https://developer.blender.org/docs/handbook/development_environments/xcode/)
Thu, Oct 31, 2024, 09:01:35 - Julian Eisel: Doesn't work for me, and looking at the errors, I'd guess it's broken for a few weeks/months already
Thu, Oct 31, 2024, 09:06:50 - Julian Eisel: First off I had to manually set the compiler paths (even though it's at the default location...) and add `CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=-std:=c++17` so it doesn't go complete bonkers when trying to build.
Thu, Oct 31, 2024, 09:08:29 - Julian Eisel: Then it freaks out here bc `_mm_testz_si128` isn't found https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/src/branch/main/source/blender/blenlib/BLI_bit_span_to_index_ranges.hh#L110
Thu, Oct 31, 2024, 09:13:55 - Julian Eisel: And it actually makes sense that it fails there, because that is a SSE4 call apparently which isn't available for Intel macs (at least with our config), and we only check for `#if BLI_HAVE_SSE2` there
Thu, Oct 31, 2024, 09:14:30 - Julian Eisel: So I have the feeling nobody is compiling with xcode and Intel currently
Thu, Oct 31, 2024, 09:14:35 - Falk David: CC Jacques Lucke ^ ?
Thu, Oct 31, 2024, 09:15:20 - @sean-kim:blender.org: Maybe Jonas Holzman too? ^
Thu, Oct 31, 2024, 09:15:47 - Iliya Katushenock: This is feature of Intel header....
Thu, Oct 31, 2024, 09:16:37 - Iliya Katushenock: Julian Eisel: Is there anything other errors/warnings?
Thu, Oct 31, 2024, 09:17:07 - @zeddb:blender.org: Wouldn't our build bots for our x86_64 mac binaries be failing if it was broken?
Thu, Oct 31, 2024, 09:17:38 - Iliya Katushenock: Like what about other instructions in the same function?
Thu, Oct 31, 2024, 09:21:45 - Falk David: Julian Eisel What CPU does your mac have?
Thu, Oct 31, 2024, 09:24:18 - Falk David: But yea you're right. Seems like `_mm_testz_si128` requires `SSE4.1` but the code checks for `SSE2`
Thu, Oct 31, 2024, 09:25:12 - @matt-mclin:blender.org: no, I will try this, thank you!
Thu, Oct 31, 2024, 09:25:16 - Falk David: We do have a `BLI_HAVE_SSE4` macro, so you could just switch it out and check if that compiles
Thu, Oct 31, 2024, 09:25:18 - Jonas Holzman: Mmmh I'm guessing a normal `make release` build works?
Thu, Oct 31, 2024, 09:26:03 - Julian Eisel: Intel i9. And yes, seems like I don't have SSE4 here, it prints "No SIMD instructions detected" on a first cmake run for a clean build https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/src/branch/main/CMakeLists.txt#L1515
Thu, Oct 31, 2024, 09:26:16 - Julian Eisel: <@brainzman:blender.org "Mmmh I'm guessing a normal `make..."> Yup, it's just when trying to compile through xcode
Thu, Oct 31, 2024, 09:26:22 - Jonas Holzman: CMake generated Xcode projects are not that well supported (in CMake in general), but if you have correctly choose to "Automatically Generate Scheme" they should be one to one with a classic CMake build
Thu, Oct 31, 2024, 09:27:03 - Julian Eisel: Seems all fine so far. Only this one. Which makes sense, since it's SSE4 while code only checks if SSE2 is available
Thu, Oct 31, 2024, 09:27:50 - Julian Eisel: Running normal `make` commands is fine. Only fails when trying to build with xcode. So really seems like an xcode + intel issue
Thu, Oct 31, 2024, 09:31:02 - Jonas Holzman: I do have an Intel mac now, so I'll try to reproduce this tomorrow, normally Xcode should use the global system toolchain (unless you have an alternative non-activated Xcode installed) so I'm guessing it might have some weird project default env variable set or expectations which are not present in a classic make build
Thu, Oct 31, 2024, 09:36:50 - Julian Eisel: Yeah, at least I can find my way around this for now. But what's more interesting is that there's a valid build error that seemingly went by unnoticed for a while
Thu, Oct 31, 2024, 09:45:54 - Jonas Holzman: Heh I can kind of see why that would happen, I believe most devs that use macOS nowadays are on ARM, and in the devs that are still on Intel, they're probably just not using Xcode, or using it and building manually
Thu, Oct 31, 2024, 09:46:54 - Jonas Holzman: I did do some Xcode builds fairly recently on an ARM Mac, and it was working well, so this might be an Intel only issue, especially if its kind of related to CPU feature macros, but I'll investigate to make sure
Thu, Oct 31, 2024, 09:47:20 - Jonas Holzman: Also in the mean time if you want to use Xcode for debugging purposes, you can build a `make debug`, and then attach Xcode to it
Thu, Oct 31, 2024, 10:01:45 - Julian Eisel: For the records, this fixed the build error:

Thu, Oct 31, 2024, 10:09:29 - LazyDodo: that's a bit odd, _mm_loadu_si128 _is_ sse2 according to the [intrinsics guide](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/intrinsics-guide/index.html#text=_mm_loadu_si128&ig_expand=4106)
Thu, Oct 31, 2024, 10:12:19 - LazyDodo: ah, the problematic one wasn't in the diff, `_mm_testz_si128` is sse4 indeed
Thu, Oct 31, 2024, 10:12:31 - Jonas Holzman: Yeah the fact that a different kind of build would affect the result of CPU feature macros is also quite puzzling

Thu, Oct 31, 2024, 10:14:01 - LazyDodo: Jonas Holzman: that is fishy indeed, i'd probably chuck some #errors into `source\blender\blenlib\BLI_simd.hh` and see what codepaths it takes between the two builds
Thu, Oct 31, 2024, 10:14:58 - LazyDodo: actually probably faster to do it in `BLI_bit_span_to_index_ranges.hh`
Thu, Oct 31, 2024, 10:15:08 - LazyDodo: maybe it's not taking the sse codepath for somereason in one of the builds
Thu, Oct 31, 2024, 10:23:54 - Jonas Holzman: Yeah will do, I'm guessing it probably comes from something set by default in Xcode build settings or phases
Thu, Oct 31, 2024, 10:24:05 - @aras_p:blender.org: But also, on all x64 build configs (including Mac for x64), all code builds paths _should_ set "please sse4.1", right? If it is not, that's a bug/issue in the build system setup.
Thu, Oct 31, 2024, 10:25:39 - LazyDodo: Aras Pranckevičius: more or less, msvc lacks a codgen switch there (we're still officially targeting sse2 there), any codepath guarded with a `BLI_HAVE_SSE4` guard will trigger though
Thu, Oct 31, 2024, 10:27:07 - LazyDodo: linux passes the right thing, and i have honestly no idea about mac, pretty sure we ran it by the platform dev at the time when we bumped to sse4
Thu, Oct 31, 2024, 10:30:32 - LazyDodo: Aras Pranckevičius:  there's actually 2 (potential) bugs here, 1) sse4 was used in a block guarded with sse2, that's a bug, no two ways about that , 2) somehow the mac build may or may not use sse on x64 depending on how you configure the build, unsure why/how/what there

Sometimes people use the same type for bitmasks of enum values as the enum itself. And that's kinda cringe, but i am so far failing persuation rolls

Fri, Nov 1, 2024, 04:55:33 - @fclem:blender.org: Sergey: Is there something we need to fix in the gpu and eevee modules for this?
Fri, Nov 1, 2024, 05:18:36 - @fclem:blender.org: Thomas Dinges: are we still targeting next week for the RC?

I was sick this week (and still am) and jeroen was away too. there are at least 2 or 3 bugs that I want to fix but I don't know I will have enough time on monday/tuesday.
Fri, Nov 1, 2024, 05:18:50 - @fclem:blender.org: Also the amount of GPencil high prio...
Fri, Nov 1, 2024, 05:21:04 - Thomas Dinges: Clément Foucault: Hi! I am still aiming to stick to the schedule. I'll monitor the situation and we can delay a bit if needed. 
Fri, Nov 1, 2024, 05:37:46 - LazyDodo: Thomas Dinges: ah rats, that one fell through the cracks, unless xavierh insists this is absolutely crucial to have i'd like to bump it to 4.4
Fri, Nov 1, 2024, 05:39:00 - Thomas Dinges: It would be pretty late to add now :/ How long would you need to do it? I think would need to be done for Windows and Linux, right?
Fri, Nov 1, 2024, 05:43:21 - LazyDodo: getting the actual libs, couple of hours, validation builds is usually where the time vampire lives especially the debug ones where i have to chase people around since beyond Bastien Montagne i don't think a whole lot of people run the tests on debug builds 
Fri, Nov 1, 2024, 05:44:04 - Thomas Dinges: Okay, let's see what xavierh thinks about it. 
Fri, Nov 1, 2024, 05:45:43 - LazyDodo: getting a debug CI build running the tests even if it's only once every couple of days/once a week wouldn't be the worst thing to have
Fri, Nov 1, 2024, 05:54:59 - Bastien Montagne: LazyDodo: It's a topic for Bart van der Braak as soon as he is done with servers migration... so still have hope for debug + asan nightly build somewhere in December 😉
Fri, Nov 1, 2024, 05:57:48 - LazyDodo: tss making him work the christmas season, easy there scrooge! 🙂 
Fri, Nov 1, 2024, 07:36:30 - @sergey:blender.org: Clément Foucault: I dunno. Mayhaps. Perchance. I didn't check it in a while to see whether there are any real issues
Fri, Nov 1, 2024, 10:28:00 - Jesse Y: Ah, didn't know I could trigger for that arch there.  Sadly looks like the test is still having issues on ARM for some reason.
Fri, Nov 1, 2024, 11:57:59 - Raiko: Could someone please start a packaged build for https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/pulls/127711

Sat, Nov 2, 2024, 10:53:01 - weatherhelm joined the room
Sat, Nov 2, 2024, 10:55:55 - weatherhelm: Hi folks, does anyone know if there has been further development around this? https://code.blender.org/2022/11/blender-apps/
Sat, Nov 2, 2024, 10:59:49 - weatherhelm: Bit more context about my project: a pipeline tool for editing a predefined mesh with deformers that users can tweak and save changes as shape keys (still figuring out how much I'll be doing with python and geo nodes)

The main advantage of something like Blender Apps for my need is ease of distribution for non-Blender users and people with no DCC experience.

That said, maybe I could accomplish something similar with a custom workspace and add-on? I could even distribute a bash script that installs blender for them.

Sat, Nov 2, 2024, 10:59:59 - weatherhelm: Looking for opinions, thanks in advance
Sat, Nov 2, 2024, 11:21:29 - danik292: Well I think It will be grate but I am not dev
Sat, Nov 2, 2024, 14:37:06 - Jonas Holzman: <@weatherhelm:blender.org "Hi folks, does anyone know if th..."> I believe the closest thing there is to the idea Blender Apps right now is advanced used of Application Templates, to which the best public example I know of is the Blender Studio's Media Viewer https://studio.blender.org/blog/media-viewer-by-blender-studio/
Sat, Nov 2, 2024, 14:37:53 - Jonas Holzman: Here's the actual repo link since the one in the article is outdated: https://projects.blender.org/studio/blender-studio-pipeline/src/branch/main/application-templates/blender-media-viewer
Sat, Nov 2, 2024, 14:40:37 - Jonas Holzman: The main interesting part for your use case would probably be the use of override helpers (`bl_app_override.helpers`) which lets you easily unregister the entire Blender interface and replace it with your own without having to resort to old manual `bl_ui` and similar tricks
Sat, Nov 2, 2024, 15:48:28 - Raiko: Could someone please start a packaged build for https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/pulls/127711

Sun, Nov 3, 2024, 07:39:22 - Raiko: Hey, I have a problem with https://builder.blender.org/admin/#/builders/135/builds/7762
When running tests it states:

```
Failed to compile library:
source/kernel/svm/rounded_polygon.h:24:10: fatal error: '../../../../source/blender/gpu/shaders/material/rounded_polygon_generic.glsl' file not found
#include "../../../../source/blender/gpu/shaders/material/rounded_polygon_generic.glsl"
```

However it compiles just fine, so obviously the file is there.
Does someone know how to fix this?
Sun, Nov 3, 2024, 08:19:19 - LazyDodo: fun with relative paths 🙂 imma put my money on the `../../../blah` path doesn't exist relative to the test binary
Sun, Nov 3, 2024, 08:21:23 - Bastien Montagne: Message deleted
Sun, Nov 3, 2024, 08:22:04 - LazyDodo: also there's a near 0% chance `/source/blender/gpu/` is gonna exist _anywhere_ on an end users system, so there may be some more trouble brewing there
Sun, Nov 3, 2024, 09:00:29 - Bastien Montagne: <@mod:blender.org "Bastien Montagne: 👋"> Should be fixed now
Sun, Nov 3, 2024, 09:34:19 - Raiko: <@lazydodo:blender.org "fun with relative paths 🙂 imma ..."> It's just `darwin-arm64` that's failing the tests, the other platforms work fine. https://builder.blender.org/admin/#/builders/136/builds/8235
Sun, Nov 3, 2024, 09:35:16 - LazyDodo: think that's the only platform running the GPU tests
Sun, Nov 3, 2024, 09:36:26 - LazyDodo: try turning `WITH_GPU_DRAW_TESTS` and `WITH_GPU_RENDER_TESTS` on , with a bit of luck that'll repro the issue locally
Sun, Nov 3, 2024, 09:36:45 - Raiko: <@lazydodo:blender.org "also there's a near 0% chance `/..."> Are the SVM GPU binaries compiled at runtime? Otherwise I don't see why it would need to be on an end users system.
Sun, Nov 3, 2024, 09:37:34 - LazyDodo: they can be
Sun, Nov 3, 2024, 09:38:26 - Raiko: Hmm, then moving the file into the SVM directory might solve the issue. 🤔
Sun, Nov 3, 2024, 09:40:59 - LazyDodo: cycles referencing blender code has a 0% chance of making it though review, so whatever you are doing is a bit of a dead end even if it had worked
Sun, Nov 3, 2024, 09:42:20 - LazyDodo: probably best just to duplicate the code rather than trying to dig your self a deep hole trying to outsmart the current infrastructure 
Sun, Nov 3, 2024, 10:33:58 - Iliya Katushenock: I am starting to think what something is broken in file saving...
Sun, Nov 3, 2024, 10:39:28 - Raiko: I moved the code to SVM, so now Cycles isn't referencing anything from another module anymore.
Now the structure is the same as that of `voronoi.h`.
Could someone please start a packaged build for https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/pulls/127711
Thanks in advance.
Sun, Nov 3, 2024, 11:24:18 - Raiko: Woohoo, it finally passed the tests!

Sun, Nov 3, 2024, 11:46:54 - linguinithepasta: hallo everyone
Sun, Nov 3, 2024, 11:47:03 - danik292: <@linguinithepasta:blender.org "hallo everyone"> hi
Sun, Nov 3, 2024, 11:48:26 - linguinithepasta: I am new to blender development, what's the best way to get up to speed on how the code "works"? I have a tiny bit of fundamental computer science knowledge (stuff like how malloc, terminals, OS, and networks are made), but I don't really know much abt graphics development
Sun, Nov 3, 2024, 12:00:05 - danik292: <@mod:blender.org "danik292: In which context did y..."> for development

Sun, Nov 3, 2024, 23:36:49 - Wu Yiming: Is it possible that a modifier (line art) could receive an update call from the scene when object gets added/removed so its `update_depsgraph()` callback gets executed again?
Sun, Nov 3, 2024, 23:37:04 - Wu Yiming: `DEG_add_collection_geometry_relation` doesn't work (also may cause loop dependency)
Sun, Nov 3, 2024, 23:39:45 - Wu Yiming: 🫠 From the look of it I think it goes against how modifier works. This basically requires modifiers to have the ability to dynamically increase its dependencies when scene changes and it won't really happen for any other modifiers
Sun, Nov 3, 2024, 23:39:58 - Wu Yiming: (Or maybe for physics/particle)
Sun, Nov 3, 2024, 23:45:57 - Iliya Katushenock: Geometry Nodes could receive all objects in whole scene in case you access scene collection
Sun, Nov 3, 2024, 23:46:05 - Iliya Katushenock: And not a part of this collection..
Sun, Nov 3, 2024, 23:48:46 - Thomas Dinges: Good morning developers 👋
It's the final week before the 4.3 release, so I have a few points that I am asking you to handle with priority.

- Please clean up the [4.3 milestone](https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/milestone/21). There are a bunch of tasks still associated that look like feature/design tasks, which are not suitable anymore. Please remove these from the milestone.  Jeroen Bakker dr.Sybren In general I am asking people to keep their tasks updated and once we reach Beta, remove items that haven't made it into the release to the next milestone.
- Keep a close eye on the bug tracker. If you're module has remaining (high priority) issues for 4.3, please identify the ones that are essential for the release and assign the 4.3 milestone to it.
Sun, Nov 3, 2024, 23:51:19 - Thomas Dinges: Jeroen Bakker: Do you have an update on https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/issues/122361 ? This one keeps stalling without visible progress. If you cannot fix it, I'd suggest to honestly communicate this and bump minimum requirements.

Mon, Nov 4, 2024, 01:14:53 - Jonas Holzman: Also Julian Eisel, I tried a few things but wasn’t able to reproduce the Xcode error you encountered last week. If you run into it again, you can ping me #blender-builds with your Xcode version number and CMakeCache and I’ll try to narrow it down more.
Mon, Nov 4, 2024, 01:54:56 - @sergey:blender.org: Jonas Holzman: Lovely! I'll have a look!

Mon, Nov 4, 2024, 02:07:42 - @aras_p:blender.org: alignment of 32 _megabytes_? that's a chonky alignment. someone accidentally swapped arguments for size vs alignment somewhere mayhaps?
Mon, Nov 4, 2024, 02:24:12 - Pablo Vazquez: Just to confirm, 4.3 is fully compatible with the [VFX Platform 2024](https://vfxplatform.com/) ? And 4.4 with 2025's ? 
Mon, Nov 4, 2024, 02:26:38 - Thomas Dinges: Pablo Vazquez: Yes
Mon, Nov 4, 2024, 02:27:07 - Pablo Vazquez: oh they updated the 2025 reference yesterday Sunday, interesting

Mon, Nov 4, 2024, 02:34:06 - Wu Yiming: for some reason every single node-related files in vscode still shows red squiggles everywhere for me
Mon, Nov 4, 2024, 03:06:24 - @sergey:blender.org: Pablo Vazquez: The initial version for CY2025 were known in September, but versions of few libraries were not known. Those are finalized now
Mon, Nov 4, 2024, 04:11:53 - @donovane:blender.org: Humm i just reading the blender manual for dev and really some line aren't clear exemple for register a node you have a line, but no explaination you give only exemple from projects already published..... Is not a bad idea if everythings can be inside the documentation with what we to do as an input !
Mon, Nov 4, 2024, 04:13:57 - Iliya Katushenock: Right nowe everything you need is just copy-past any other node implementation file and just change naming, and add this node to CMake, bke enum, rna list and python UI
Mon, Nov 4, 2024, 04:14:37 - @donovane:blender.org: Yeah i know by deduction, you learn me nothing i already been do that, but if you don't know how to proceed by using the exemple you don't know !
Mon, Nov 4, 2024, 04:14:43 - @donovane:blender.org: And is a very bad point !
Mon, Nov 4, 2024, 04:15:42 - Iliya Katushenock: Threre is large commit and PR's history
Mon, Nov 4, 2024, 04:16:02 - @donovane:blender.org: Isn't a reason for not documenting 😂🤷‍♂️
Mon, Nov 4, 2024, 04:16:14 - Iliya Katushenock: Reason
Mon, Nov 4, 2024, 04:16:56 - Iliya Katushenock: At least not such lite details like in which file some enum is today
Mon, Nov 4, 2024, 04:17:09 - @donovane:blender.org: 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️ Some thing have no sens and trigger me .... But ... I give more my time for making better documentation in the future
Mon, Nov 4, 2024, 04:43:10 - danik292: Where is UI code located
Mon, Nov 4, 2024, 04:44:48 - Falk David: Depends on what part of the UI
Mon, Nov 4, 2024, 04:45:05 - Wu Yiming: kind of everywhere
Mon, Nov 4, 2024, 05:12:31 - @lukastonne:blender.org: `BKE_brush_color_set` currently updates _either_ `Brush.color` _or_ `UnifiedPaintSettings.color`. For Grease Pencil we need this to be context-based (mode). It was already broken in GPv2 for palette updates, just not noticeable in default settings. How can i make this less horrible?
Mon, Nov 4, 2024, 05:12:45 - @lukastonne:blender.org: can i just update both colors?
Mon, Nov 4, 2024, 05:25:48 - @lukastonne:blender.org: plan: add something to the button to tell the handler to ignore UPS, then add an extended `BKE_brush_color_set_ex` that does just that.

Mon, Nov 4, 2024, 07:20:58 - Thomas Dinges: Thank you
Mon, Nov 4, 2024, 07:43:47 - @sean-kim:blender.org: Lukas Tönne: I dont have the full context of what you’re trying to do in gpv3, but something to keep in mind with the brush assets change is that changes to the brush-level color aren’t persisted with save 
Mon, Nov 4, 2024, 08:00:21 - Thomas Dinges: Second kick-off is now 🔔
Mon, Nov 4, 2024, 08:24:20 - Pablo Vazquez: <@thomasdinges:blender.org "Friendly reminder about release ..."> Also, don't forget about the manual please <3 Even more important than the release notes IMHO 
Mon, Nov 4, 2024, 08:28:24 - Thomas Dinges: We have a standing policy to add release notes / docs *with* the commit. Don't expect Aaron to write everything. You can ask him for help but first and foremost every developer is responsible to make sure their changes are documented. 
Mon, Nov 4, 2024, 08:29:35 - Thomas Dinges: I am a bit tired repeating this every release and finding out a week before that things are missing
Mon, Nov 4, 2024, 08:39:35 - Thomas Dinges: For 4.4 I'll consider making it mandatory to link to the commit and the manual from the release notes. So for every notable change it would be:
`Short description of what's new [Link to commit] [Link to manual]`

I said before, that I am fine giving people some space and only require the change + link to commit at first, and worry about fancy pictures and manual later, but this doesn't seem to work
Mon, Nov 4, 2024, 08:49:24 - Pablo Vazquez: This release cycle was particularly bad.
* Some features added a week later because I found out on someone's YouTube video showing it, that wasn't even mentioned in the release notes. 
* Sections pointing to old docs.
Mon, Nov 4, 2024, 08:52:28 - Pablo Vazquez: But as well credit where credit is due: Geometry Nodes team has great docs. Would be even more perfect if it pointed to the manual :D but overall great, including all new nodes marked as **bold**: https://developer.blender.org/docs/release_notes/4.3/geometry_nodes/
Mon, Nov 4, 2024, 08:52:43 - Pablo Vazquez: And Harley's work on the UI notes also super nice
Mon, Nov 4, 2024, 08:54:20 - Thomas Dinges: I'd assume that people are proud of their work and like things to be documented and visible to artists. We can do better here, right? :) 
Mon, Nov 4, 2024, 09:06:12 - Thomas Dinges: <@thomasdinges:blender.org "For 4.4 I'll consider making it ..."> Seems this is already the case even. So for reference:
* [New Commiters](https://developer.blender.org/docs/handbook/guidelines/new_committers/) `Document new features and changes in the release notes, either before or directly after committing a feature. Please follow the guidelines.`
* [Guidelines](https://developer.blender.org/docs/handbook/guidelines/release_notes/) `Add link to the git commit or pull requests at the end of each feature.` and `Whenever possible, link to the manual entry where to read more about the feature.`
Mon, Nov 4, 2024, 09:10:30 - LazyDodo: Whenever possible != mandatory 
Mon, Nov 4, 2024, 09:14:10 - Thomas Dinges: A performance improvement for example doesn't have to be documented, a new button in the UI should be though. 
Mon, Nov 4, 2024, 09:17:25 - Pablo Vazquez sent an image. (Media omitted)
Mon, Nov 4, 2024, 09:17:42 - Pablo Vazquez: or a new texture. I mean at least to have an _idea_ of how it looks hah
Mon, Nov 4, 2024, 09:29:25 - Pablo Vazquez: > uiLayout.template_search() accepts a new text argument to let the template add a label. It will respect `uiLayout.use_property_split` and `uiLayout.use_property_decorate`.

Does anyone know the commit for this Python API change? https://developer.blender.org/docs/release_notes/4.3/python_api/#user-interface
Mon, Nov 4, 2024, 09:31:10 - Falk David: Maybe https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/pulls/127751
Mon, Nov 4, 2024, 09:32:24 - Pablo Vazquez: that looks like it, thanks! I'll add it to the release notes

Tue, Nov 5, 2024, 01:48:52 - SensArice: 
Has anyone tried compiling Blender to "WASM" to achieve the goal of compiling the source code only once for use in browsers on almost all operating systems, which might require preparing different compatibility package files for various systems on the server...
Tue, Nov 5, 2024, 02:03:55 - @lukastonne:blender.org: what is the purpose of the [PaintMode](https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/src/commit/4aa18b7242f508c0c81f8d5b5bc480ded955606b/source/blender/blenkernel/BKE_paint.hh#L92-L113)? We already have object modes, context modes, why do we need yet another one?
Tue, Nov 5, 2024, 02:06:59 - @lukastonne:blender.org: (yes it's causing bugs because this stuff has to be somewhat in sync with the other modes)
Tue, Nov 5, 2024, 02:16:31 - @jacqueslucke:blender.org: ideasman42 hey, do you have an idea for how to approach [#128948](https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/issues/128948)? It feels like the same issue could happen in many other cases when switching the area type in a script.
Tue, Nov 5, 2024, 02:20:12 - ideasman42: Hey Jacques Lucke ... is there any reason an RNA set function could not explicitly clear `snode->edittree` immediately?
... handle any cleanup/teardown that's needed for further updates to work correctly.
Tue, Nov 5, 2024, 02:24:46 - @jacqueslucke:blender.org: ideasman42 guess we could do that. I'm not aware of a reason for why it's not done. I guess that would need to be added in `rna_Area_type_update` somewhere?
Tue, Nov 5, 2024, 02:25:33 - ideasman42: Checking, running in update should be OK, (at the end of the callback I suppose).
Tue, Nov 5, 2024, 02:29:25 - @jacqueslucke:blender.org: ok, will give it a try, thanks
Tue, Nov 5, 2024, 04:39:07 - LazyDodo: SensArice: yes, build/link times made it a very unpleasant project to work on, got it up and running without the UI then gave up on it
Tue, Nov 5, 2024, 07:38:16 - @jacqueslucke:blender.org: ideasman42 regarding the bug from earlier today, would be good if you could check the fix: https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/pulls/129870

Tue, Nov 5, 2024, 09:01:03 - SensArice: Regarding whether to delete "string_select_line," my view is opposite to that of "liya," so I want to bring in another person to review it, hoping that we can decide by a vote of three people.
Tue, Nov 5, 2024, 09:01:18 - Hans Goudey: Hi SensArice, ideally your PR would have some more information and justification as part of the description. https://developer.blender.org/docs/handbook/contributing/#Ingredients_of_a_Pull_Request
Tue, Nov 5, 2024, 09:03:37 - SensArice: Hans Goudey: 
Tue, Nov 5, 2024, 09:10:33 - SensArice: Do I need to provide more detailed explanations for the feature I submitted and add more demonstration files?
Tue, Nov 5, 2024, 09:14:41 - Hans Goudey: TBH I think that page I linked should give you plenty more ideas of things to add to the description

Tue, Nov 5, 2024, 10:24:17 - Jonas Holzman: Sometimes it can happen regularly if you have "ghost window" that macOS *think* is drawing over the main Blender window when it's actually not, you can check if that's the case by right-clicking blender in the taskbar and checking the window list

Tue, Nov 5, 2024, 10:55:42 - Nurb2Kea: <@brainzman:blender.org "That's a somewhat common macOS w..."> From years experience it's blender related. We have the same issue when rendering high res images and after each sample it flickers the rendered image between samples, especially when moving the mouse over blender window borders. It was also mentioned to Harley Acheson when having the issue with the 'blender window border drag size is to small', that the "Mouse Pointer flickers" and makes it very hard to move the border of windows, because you don't know if you over the active border area or not. But I guess, not taking reports serious, backfires like this issue now. I have no similar experience with native macOS apps.

Mentioning it to developers on brief occasions is certainly not enough as we just cannot keep track of it. Mouse flickers due to area resize region being too small is a separate issue (compared to this case where the cursor constantly flickers) which I believe has already been adressed

Tue, Nov 5, 2024, 11:17:41 - @harleya:blender.org: We made the mouse hit size for area movement wider for 4.3, and that probably started from some conversation with someone. But sorry I don’t recall anything about “flickery cursors”

Tue, Nov 5, 2024, 11:30:31 - @harleya:blender.org: Yeah that conversation fizzles out with me asking lots of questions trying to clarify exactly what you are experiencing (since I don’t have a Mac or High-dpi display, and you refusing to answer them. LOL
Tue, Nov 5, 2024, 11:33:41 - SensArice: When it comes to high-resolution displays on MacOS, I often encounter issues where I can't select bones while doing animations, which is very frustrating. I believe that the Blender developers should have someone specifically buy a device to test this.
Tue, Nov 5, 2024, 11:34:31 - Nurb2Kea: <@harleya:blender.org "Yeah that conversation fizzles o..."> Is that my issue that you don't have access to a Mac. And I reported the issue, and If I can't follow your pixel perfect screenshots for hours, that makes you LOL. Interesting. Anyways, now that you know again what it's about, that it's a blender MacOS issue you can continue. I'm not wasting my time, you're the devs, I'm not.
Tue, Nov 5, 2024, 11:34:50 - Iliya Katushenock: Things can be much shorter IMO, just with few more value\
Tue, Nov 5, 2024, 11:35:00 - SensArice: I think it should be the "Apple team" who should be directly notified to handle this.
Tue, Nov 5, 2024, 11:42:29 - SensArice: I've already decided to write a 3 to 5-page paper using "8pt font" for the feature I submitted.
Tue, Nov 5, 2024, 11:44:38 - @harleya:blender.org: Fairly certain that anyone reading the PDF you linked above will see that I spent hours in your direct messages to me personally, asking you lots of questions and making captures and illustrations for you. But you ended with “conversation closed by not willing to understand the issue”. So you gave up and didn’t seem willing to do much to help me understand.

And none of that seems related to the “flickery cursors” currently being discussed.
Tue, Nov 5, 2024, 11:47:21 - @harleya:blender.org: Sending me a direct message is not “reporting the issue”. That would be filing a bug report, which could then be seen by someone who actually owns a Mac.
Tue, Nov 5, 2024, 11:50:49 - SensArice: I have a MacBook pro m2
Tue, Nov 5, 2024, 11:53:37 - Nurb2Kea: That's what I think you don't remember, that I told you about the flickering and at the end of the pdf you can read the part where I said something 'snippy' to try it out with a bigger size of the active border are. So who didn't understand the case and wasn't willing to follow. I'm not here to assist you with all tests. I have work to do, like you do. AND all the mouse cursor flickering , active border area issue and render flickering came up at once. And I can remember very good our coversation about this. Anyways, makes no sense to continue here, the issue is there and all related together in my eyes. And by having someone of blender staff having at least one of this issues, there is no need for me to file a bugreport. You as a dev can do it better I guess. 
Tue, Nov 5, 2024, 12:08:10 - Hans Goudey: <@sensarice:blender.org "I've already decided to write a ..."> A longer description doesn't necessarily mean it's better
Tue, Nov 5, 2024, 12:10:14 - Jonas Holzman: SensArice: We certainly do have developers (such as myself) that are working specifically on macOS. If you're encountering such an issue, please open a bug report
Tue, Nov 5, 2024, 12:11:56 - @harleya:blender.org: The mouse cursor flickering is almost certainly a separate Mac-specific issue. The widened area edge hit area was done afterward and should help a bit. For the small corner zones I think we should consider enlarging the top-left one (only) now that all four work identically. Note you can also now avoid using them at all by adding a shortcut to the operator. I had intended on buying a Mac for this Conference trip, but it didn’t work out yet.
Tue, Nov 5, 2024, 13:08:54 - Nurb2Kea: <@harleya:blender.org "The mouse cursor flickering is a..."> Good it didn't work out yet. BECAUSE the new Mac mini M4 now, is a beast for the small buck, if you don't want a MacBook.
Tue, Nov 5, 2024, 15:20:14 - @cmbasnett:blender.org: What is the way to force an update of the outliner? I want to make it so that the outliner is immediately updated when an edit bone's parent is changed. I tried adding `WM_main_add_notifier(NC_SPACE | ND_SPACE_OUTLINER, id);` to the update function, but no dice.

Wed, Nov 6, 2024, 01:04:44 - @sergey:blender.org: Thomas Dinges: Hey! So, I have a dice set. We roll 20, if it's a crit we move to RC?
Wed, Nov 6, 2024, 01:09:09 - @raimund58:blender.org: Sergey: What happens if you roll a 1?
Wed, Nov 6, 2024, 01:09:58 - @sergey:blender.org: we give up on 4.3, skip it, and focus on 4.4?
Wed, Nov 6, 2024, 01:10:38 - @sergey:blender.org: Looking at the state of the milestone, there is so much red: https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/milestone/21
Wed, Nov 6, 2024, 01:10:57 - Wu Yiming: I think I have seen such bone selection problem reported a few days back on mac with high res displays
Wed, Nov 6, 2024, 02:23:05 - Thomas Dinges: Good day! 
Wed, Nov 6, 2024, 02:25:32 - Alaska: Bad news for you. My D20 says go to release candidate.
Wed, Nov 6, 2024, 02:26:11 - ideasman42: Messaged the "Modeling" room, to see if anyones able to help out with this.
Wed, Nov 6, 2024, 02:27:51 - Thomas Dinges: There are 23 open issues on the 4.3 milestone, way too many to call for an Release Candidate. I therefore propose to postpone the 4.3 release by one week. That means:
* RC on November 13th
* Release on November 19th

As a result, I expect everyone (who has remaining 4.3 issues open) to solely focus on these. I do not want to see 4.4 development while issues are not addressed. 
Wed, Nov 6, 2024, 02:29:01 - Thomas Dinges: If anyone has objections or remarks about this please let me know today.
Wed, Nov 6, 2024, 02:30:04 - Thomas Dinges: Additionally, everyone helping out with bug fixes is very welcome. I think especially the Grease Pencil team could use some help
Wed, Nov 6, 2024, 02:48:31 - SensArice: The reason there hasn't been any administrator review of my submissions these days is that everyone is busy with the 4.3？, the list of issues regarding 4.3...
Wed, Nov 6, 2024, 02:54:30 - @harleya:blender.org: Of the things on our list I’m a little concerned about #129414. On X11 (only) drag and drop and area maintenance routines won’t work correctly if you have multiple overlapping windows when the window on top is older than the one below. For all other platforms we have OS-specific code to give us the top-most window at a location, but we don’t have that for X11 so we get the default behaviour for overlapping windows, that newer ones are more likely to be on top. It seems unlikely that we will find someone to add this X11 ghost code quickly since we’ve managed without it for so long.
Wed, Nov 6, 2024, 03:05:47 - @sergey:blender.org: SensArice: Which submissions you expects administrators to review?
Wed, Nov 6, 2024, 03:06:13 - SensArice: I see that there are still 20 bugs to fix in 4.3, but none of them are in the modules I'm familiar with. I'm particularly interested in #129058, but I can't really help with it.
Wed, Nov 6, 2024, 03:08:39 - SensArice: My PR is still undergoing modifications, so I can definitely wait until next week to notify the The code is under review. I also support prioritizing bug fixes.
At least the code for the geometry nodes part needs to be fixed first..Sergey
Wed, Nov 6, 2024, 03:10:47 - @sergey:blender.org: I suppose you mean something else by admin than someone from the bf-admin team?
Wed, Nov 6, 2024, 03:11:07 - @sergey:blender.org: The report you've mentioned has been added to the 4.3 milestone. I assume Julian wants it to be addressed

Wed, Nov 6, 2024, 03:26:22 - Wu Yiming: 🤔 looks to me it's enough of description, maybe a summary of the patch on the top would be good
Wed, Nov 6, 2024, 03:26:38 - Iliya Katushenock: I think here is some language barrier
Wed, Nov 6, 2024, 03:27:33 - Wu Yiming: 🤔 maybe I could try formatting it so the purpose of the PR is more understandable
Wed, Nov 6, 2024, 03:29:28 - Hans Goudey: Okay yeah that's much more detail than I saw yesterday, nice

Wed, Nov 6, 2024, 06:05:06 - @steffend:blender.org: <@chengdulittlea:blender.org "any linux wizard here who could ..."> Not a Linux wizard, but to me this sounds a lot like Blender running as a Snap or Flatpak in some sort of sandbox with limited access to system drives / mounts. Had that before, when e.g. drag and drop of files didn't work with Blender or with Chrome (when trying to upload files to Google Drive website etc.).
Wed, Nov 6, 2024, 06:06:26 - Wu Yiming: The user did say `I download it from the daily builds site` so it _should_ be just fine, and older blender version works too
Wed, Nov 6, 2024, 06:17:27 - LazyDodo: given they imply this recently broke you could ask them to try some builds from https://builder.blender.org/download/daily/archive/ see when exactly it broke
Wed, Nov 6, 2024, 06:17:42 - LazyDodo: may give some clues on what caused it
Wed, Nov 6, 2024, 06:23:45 - @steffend:blender.org: I'm compiling Blender main on Linux several times a day and I didn't notice anything like this so far. The report mentions 4.3 beta, so I downloaded the daily beta build. And 4.2.3, 4.3.0beta from today and a build of main from 5 minutes ago all show the same volumes here.
Wed, Nov 6, 2024, 06:24:49 - LazyDodo: "works for me" you're 95% on your way to becoming a true developer 🙂  
Wed, Nov 6, 2024, 06:30:22 - @steffend:blender.org: I know the pain as an end user reporting a bug that noone else can reproduce. 🫠  Many times a "--factory-startup" brought the solution, because an addon caused pain or my prefs became problematic over the course of many updates.
Wed, Nov 6, 2024, 07:06:15 - Jonas Holzman: <@sergey:blender.org "Jonas Holzman: Hey! Do you have ..."> Hey sure! Just saw your reply on it. As I said in the issue, I do have a fix underway for this which I had planned to release as a PR tonight. As you pointed out, I had accounted for reversing the image in `getClipboard`, but not in `putClipboard`. While fixing this is trivial (by just porting the reversing logic from one function to another), what I've been trying to figure out is *why* it magically broke, since the same code yielded correct results when the feature was merged. Unfortunately, I do not have the mac I originally developed the feature on to compare, and since Alaska was able to reproduce this on the original feature commit, the culprit would *seem* to lie within the macOS API
Wed, Nov 6, 2024, 07:07:48 - Hans Goudey: Hey Pratik Borhade, looks like your commit comes with a merge error :P https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/commit/2d37a3a1a77b65ea3a50fc1a1c27b89217a558b6
Wed, Nov 6, 2024, 07:08:23 - Jonas Holzman: In that sense, I started writing a fix using a different API (CoreGraphics) to reverse and create the image, but ideally I would have liked to have been able to figure out why macOS BitmapImageRep API line ordering magically changed
Wed, Nov 6, 2024, 07:08:25 - @pratikpb2125:blender.org: I thought I resolved that 🙃
Sorry
Wed, Nov 6, 2024, 07:08:42 - Jonas Holzman: In any case, I'll make the PR tonight
Wed, Nov 6, 2024, 07:08:52 - Hans Goudey: Haha no worries. This is why I would rather we leave fixing warnings to the authors (Campbell "fixed" it in main)
Wed, Nov 6, 2024, 07:09:18 - @sergey:blender.org: Jonas Holzman: Ah, okay. Lovely to hear you're working on a fix. That was one part of the question: to sync between me and you to see who can work on the fix
Wed, Nov 6, 2024, 07:09:36 - @sergey:blender.org: Jonas Holzman: I could also reproduce the issue with the original commit, if that helps with any knowledge :)
Wed, Nov 6, 2024, 07:11:15 - Jonas Holzman: Heh, I'm starting to doubt if it even worked correctly in the first place 😵‍💫 but the demo gif in the original feature PR does show it correctly working originally...
Wed, Nov 6, 2024, 07:23:33 - @pratikpb2125:blender.org: Just pushed the commit, thanks :D

This time, I built main branch locally to ensure nothing is broken 😅

Wed, Nov 6, 2024, 10:20:57 - LazyDodo: we no longer have a python section, i see _why_ an old thread was resurrected rather than a new one stared, but while i appreciate the clever loop hole, it just wasn't gonna fly

Wed, Nov 6, 2024, 10:39:47 - @rawalanche:blender.org: I am adding Toggle Xray property to 3D view selection operators (box/circle/lasso) so that users don't need to rely on wonky addons for this essential functionality. I want to do it in such a minimal non intrusive way so it doesn't get rejected for arbitrary reasons again, so it's just a operator property in a keymap. I want to toggle xray ON only if it was off before select operation and toggle it back off only if it wasn't one before select operation. This requires some bool to track the state outside of the scope of the WM_gesture_box functions. I have no clue what the right place for such variable is. 

I made a properties function to collect 3d_view specific properties for selection operators, and tried to put it there as a hidden property, but PROP_HIDDEN doesn't hide the property for keymap items.
Wed, Nov 6, 2024, 10:41:33 - @rawalanche:blender.org: Static bool is naive, straightforward solution, but it doesn't feel right.
Wed, Nov 6, 2024, 10:54:22 - @rawalanche:blender.org sent an image. (Media omitted)
Wed, Nov 6, 2024, 10:54:24 - @rawalanche:blender.org: I got this:
```
void toggle_xray(bContext *C, wmOperator *op, bool start)
{
  View3D *v3d = CTX_wm_view3d(C);

  // Store the initial X-Ray state when called at the start
  if (start) {
    if (!RNA_boolean_get(op->ptr, "initial_xray_state")) {
      bool xray_enabled = (v3d && (v3d->shading.flag & V3D_SHADING_XRAY)) != 0;
      RNA_boolean_set(op->ptr, "initial_xray_state", xray_enabled);
    }

    // Toggle X-Ray on only if it was initially off
    if (RNA_boolean_get(op->ptr, "toggle_xray") && !RNA_boolean_get(op->ptr, "initial_xray_state"))
    {
      WM_operator_name_call(C, "VIEW3D_OT_toggle_xray", WM_OP_EXEC_DEFAULT, NULL, NULL);
    }
  }
  else {
    // Toggle X-Ray off only if we manually enabled it at the start
    if (RNA_boolean_get(op->ptr, "toggle_xray") && !RNA_boolean_get(op->ptr, "initial_xray_state"))
    {
      WM_operator_name_call(C, "VIEW3D_OT_toggle_xray", WM_OP_EXEC_DEFAULT, NULL, NULL);
    }
  }
}
```
which is called from WM_gesture_box_invoke and WM_gesture_box_modal. It all works, and would allow users to simply enable a few keymap properties to get this much desired functionality. I just really need to find a way to either hide that other property, or find other way to store the state. 
Wed, Nov 6, 2024, 10:54:53 - @rawalanche:blender.org: I just don't know what the right place for it is.

Wed, Nov 6, 2024, 17:03:38 - @sean-kim:blender.org: <@rawalanche:blender.org "Static bool is naive, straightfo..."> I suspect a more correct place for this is the `View3D_Runtime` struct, since the associated temporary state you're working with is related to it.
Wed, Nov 6, 2024, 18:10:46 - @cmbasnett:blender.org: https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/pulls/129933 That worked, thanks; needed to pass the `nullptr` as the last argument in order for it to work.
Wed, Nov 6, 2024, 21:22:41 - @sean-kim:blender.org: FYI: iss getting the following warning after `b05e932ec62bd7284e02b2db6f27288315c9e936`:

Wed, Nov 6, 2024, 21:25:01 - @iss:blender.org: or maybe yes, I get different error 
Wed, Nov 6, 2024, 21:25:08 - @sean-kim:blender.org:  I was seeing it in a branch off of 4.3
Wed, Nov 6, 2024, 21:26:38 - @iss:blender.org: That should be fixed by 273bccb10814cf047a51bf44112e6c5e93a33a67
Wed, Nov 6, 2024, 21:28:14 - @sean-kim:blender.org: Oh, i see
Wed, Nov 6, 2024, 21:28:20 - @sean-kim:blender.org: that commit isnt in 4.3 apparently

Wed, Nov 6, 2024, 21:32:23 - @iss:blender.org: Dunno, probably nothing would happen if 4.3 would have this warning... Thomas Dinges Should I cherry-pick this into 4.3?

Thu, Nov 7, 2024, 01:14:52 - Thomas Dinges: Sean Kim iss It's a compile time warning only, right? Have a extra pair of eyes review it at this point please before cherry-picking onto 4.3
Thu, Nov 7, 2024, 01:21:16 - @pratikpb2125:blender.org: Cherry-pick would cause conflict due to the grease_pencil part that I fixed yesterday 😅

Thu, Nov 7, 2024, 01:22:08 - Thomas Dinges: Oh well, then we leave it out. It should not cause any user bugs
Thu, Nov 7, 2024, 01:29:20 - @sergey:blender.org: Donovane: It is hard not to use it. That is how you provide your topology to the OSD.
Thu, Nov 7, 2024, 01:30:00 - @sergey:blender.org: The more interesting question: how good the _modern_ Far is used in Blender. There were quite some additions to it after we did OSD 3 integration 
Thu, Nov 7, 2024, 01:32:17 - @sergey:blender.org: One of the interesting things to look into nowadays would be Bfr. With the reaosnings beaing:
- If we track changed grids during a stroke, Bfr might provide more optimal way of propagating changes (although, there might be completely different approach to this proble mas well)
- It can be hooked up to a cost functor and fed to Ceres, with the goal being do much more accurate "apply base".
Thu, Nov 7, 2024, 01:42:19 - @donovane:blender.org: Mhhh very interresting ! And so actually bfr aren't used actually in blender if i understand crrectly ? 
Thu, Nov 7, 2024, 02:01:07 - Thomas Dinges: The extended release date for 4.3 is official now: https://devtalk.blender.org/t/new-release-date-blender-4-3/37442
Thu, Nov 7, 2024, 02:03:29 - Thomas Dinges: As said yesterday, I urge everyone to focus on 4.3, not only on bugs but also making sure the release notes and documentation is in good shape.
Thu, Nov 7, 2024, 02:24:57 - @donovane:blender.org: I'm just found the file when far:: are used.... LMAO in mesh\_subdivsion.cpp ....
Thu, Nov 7, 2024, 02:34:44 - @donovane:blender.org: Btw i see this parameter, but when i enable it he have no effect any idea ?

`  subdiv_settings.is_adaptive = false;`

Yet is implemented 🤔🤔
Thu, Nov 7, 2024, 02:59:50 - @sergey:blender.org: That option only affects on the way how patches are generated, not the way how they are evaluated
Thu, Nov 7, 2024, 03:00:18 - @sergey:blender.org: On user level it is the "Use Limit Surface"
Thu, Nov 7, 2024, 03:00:50 - @donovane:blender.org: Oh dawn.... isn't clearly explained... God.... Okay thanks sergey :)
Thu, Nov 7, 2024, 03:01:05 - @donovane:blender.org: The var name don't glue to the function, it was really confusing !

Thu, Nov 7, 2024, 03:53:05 - dr.Sybren: For those who are interested: I wrote a little Fish shell function that lists/deletes Git branches whose upstream tracking branch is gone. I use this all the time after landing a bunch of PRs (and deleting their branches via Gitea).

It's basically two invocations of `git` and one of `awk`, it's all quite simple, but I use it so much I wanted to have it in a handy package.

Thu, Nov 7, 2024, 06:04:17 - @jacqueslucke:blender.org: Does someone have an idea what happened here? I added one line to the 4.2 backport list, but when I look at the diff, it shows multiple added lines. Doesn't make any sense to me: https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/issues/124452
Thu, Nov 7, 2024, 06:05:14 - @jacqueslucke:blender.org: Oh, looks like OmarEmaraDev happened to edit it at the same time maybe?
Thu, Nov 7, 2024, 06:06:24 - @jacqueslucke:blender.org: Now the diff says that Omar added the commit that I just added. It's fine, but fairly confusing.
Thu, Nov 7, 2024, 06:06:26 - @omaremaradev:blender.org: Jacques Lucke: I only added one line as well, but it shows that I added many lines.

Thu, Nov 7, 2024, 06:07:10 - Alaska: In my experience, it seems that Gitea likes to clump many small actions into a single large event, even if they're from different people.
Thu, Nov 7, 2024, 06:07:36 - Thomas Dinges: Indeed, I would not put much trust into the edit history
Thu, Nov 7, 2024, 06:07:55 - Alaska: It has been fixed.
Thu, Nov 7, 2024, 06:08:09 - @jacqueslucke:blender.org: Maybe it somehow limits it to 20 edits? xD
Thu, Nov 7, 2024, 06:08:36 - Alaska: Time to report a bug upstream?
Thu, Nov 7, 2024, 06:34:46 - dr.Sybren: ideasman42 I'm trying to figure out how Blender's Extensions code works. I found some "Extension Public API" in `addon_utils.py` but it's rather undocumented. What does `extensions_refresh()` do, and what do its parameters mean? IMO a "public API" should have some level of understandability without having to dig through internal function implementations.

Thu, Nov 7, 2024, 07:30:12 - @sergey:blender.org: We'll have a more detailed look as soon as time allows
Thu, Nov 7, 2024, 07:56:52 - LazyDodo: not seeing it in the codestyle, what's our official stance on c++ lambda's? use when there's no other way, or use everywhere you possibly can?
Thu, Nov 7, 2024, 07:58:11 - LazyDodo: (context have a codereview that uses one, i personally think it's an eyesore but beyond "i don't like it" i got nothing, and 'i don't like it" isn't a very compelling argument against them)
Thu, Nov 7, 2024, 08:17:58 - Hans Goudey: Somewhere in the middle I guess?
Thu, Nov 7, 2024, 08:20:50 - LazyDodo: how to determine that middle though, i find it hard to tell people to change stuff cause i _personally_ don't like it 
Thu, Nov 7, 2024, 08:21:34 - LazyDodo: https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/pulls/129974/files look for `config.pfCallback` , i see no reason for a lambda there, at the same time i don't see us adapting a "don't do things ray doesn't like" rule anytime soon 🙂
Thu, Nov 7, 2024, 08:29:47 - Hans Goudey: I guess personally I don't have a problem with that. But you could make a case for the benefits of having it be a separate function?
Thu, Nov 7, 2024, 09:04:41 - Iliya Katushenock: Lambda is better then free function in case you just need to pass this into one function as argument
Thu, Nov 7, 2024, 09:09:22 - neylmahfouf joined the room
Thu, Nov 7, 2024, 11:37:03 - mano-wii: In this case we could include a guideline: Prefer to use lambdas only as `prvalues`.
Then we will know better when to decide to use one or the other.
Thu, Nov 7, 2024, 11:39:44 - LazyDodo: I decided to let it be in the review, as i had no strong arguments against it, but some guidance in our code-style likely be nice imho
Thu, Nov 7, 2024, 11:40:02 - LazyDodo: even if it's "go crazy, they can go anywhere"
Thu, Nov 7, 2024, 13:08:56 - piotao: Hello lovely devs! Do you think it's possible to translate Blender into Polish in a way that allows some commonly used English terms to be translated into two or more words, depending on context? Currently, the Polish translation has been on hold for many years, and when I tried to work on it some time ago, I ran into major issues because of this.
For example:
The word 'point' appears only once in Blender's language file, but it is used in multiple contexts within Blender.
In Polish, 'point' translates to several different words depending on the context. It could mean pointing in a certain direction or refer to a point in space (like a vertex), etc.
The issue is that I would need to split some single English words into multiple Polish words to preserve the meaning in each context. But here's my main question: would this approach interfere with other translations that rely on the original English term?
My understanding—please correct me if I'm wrong—is that a good translation should ideally be reversible, meaning it should go back to English (and then to the target language again) without altering the original meaning. However, this is not the case here. Does anyone have any thoughts on this? Other than that - is it possible to create a language file, where such 'point' will be in several places, ready to be translated to different polish words?

Thu, Nov 7, 2024, 21:42:44 - ideasman42: dr.Sybren: ack, you're right. This relates to wheel support which was more rushed than I'd have liked... docs suffered.
I'll add a doc-string to explain it's purpose.
Thu, Nov 7, 2024, 21:52:49 - ideasman42: Sean Kim: yes, in situations where it changes based on the context, user-data ... etc.

The function should account for documentation though & return all values when the context is nullptr.
_Tsk, no docstring... better add one_
Thu, Nov 7, 2024, 22:24:23 - @memento:blender.org: Thomas Dinges: Good morning Thomas, the Mac builds for Blender 4.3.0 did not pass this night...
Thu, Nov 7, 2024, 23:24:40 - ideasman42: Thoughts?

```
Ensure data relating to extensions is up to date.                                                                                         
This should be called after extensions on the file-system have changed.                                                                   
                                                                                                                                          
:arg ensure_wheels: When true, refresh installed wheels with wheels used by extensions.                                               
:type ensure_wheels: bool                                                                                                                 
:arg addon_modules_pending: Refresh these add-ons by listing their package names, as if they these add-ons are enabled.                                                       
   This is needed so wheels can be setup before the add-on is enabled.

> When true, synchronize installed wheels with wheels used by extensions.

For me "synchronize" implies a bidirectional process. Is that the case here? Or is it a matter of installing the extension-bundled wheel files into some globally-accessible place?

> addon_modules_pending

The explanation is great (it's something I wouldn't have thought of myself). Maybe add that these are add-on package names? Or something else?

Not sure we can do anything about it on short notice, also seems to happen with older builds too (all tracks are now run via the new Steam Linux runtime) but if we cannot fix this from our side, it should be documented somewhere for the time being. Any suggestions?
Fri, Nov 8, 2024, 01:50:04 - @sergey:blender.org: Wait for Sebastian to become unsick and let him dig?
Fri, Nov 8, 2024, 01:50:35 - @sergey:blender.org: I've replied in one of the reports, hopefully the author might run some tests and provide extra clues
Fri, Nov 8, 2024, 01:52:19 - @sergey:blender.org: Since its started to happen for the old builds as well, I wouldn't consider it a stopper for 4.3. We can have the compat command line argument in the `NOTE` in the issue description. And if we can't fix the issue before 4.3 we also add that note to the release notes

Fri, Nov 8, 2024, 03:06:50 - Falk David: Hans Goudey Do you happen to know some examples of tests that apply geonodes modifiers? 
Fri, Nov 8, 2024, 03:07:20 - Hans Goudey: @[Falk David] yeah all of the geometry nodes tests haha
Fri, Nov 8, 2024, 03:07:40 - Falk David: the python ones?
Fri, Nov 8, 2024, 03:07:51 - Hans Goudey: Yes
Fri, Nov 8, 2024, 03:09:02 - Hans Goudey: The first step for GP tests is probably to make a function that compares GP data blocks. Currently we only have one for meshes. All the tests just convert the data to a mesh
Fri, Nov 8, 2024, 03:09:35 - Falk David: ~~Hm I think that would techincally work for GP too~~ Scratch that, GP has keyframes 😅
Fri, Nov 8, 2024, 03:16:28 - Falk David: Ugh, ok so I need something like `rna_Mesh_unit_test_compare` :(
Fri, Nov 8, 2024, 03:17:13 - Hans Goudey: Yes, it will be much simpler for curves though
Fri, Nov 8, 2024, 03:17:34 - Hans Goudey: IIRC GPv3 already added a function that compares two curves geometries
Fri, Nov 8, 2024, 03:18:40 - Falk David: Hm but I think it would be important to also compare keyframes. That's pretty important for modifier evaluation
Fri, Nov 8, 2024, 03:31:57 - Hans Goudey: Yeah for sure

Fri, Nov 8, 2024, 07:38:40 - Julian Eisel: Now, there should be some public communication about that, so I suggested to start with a post to propose/announce the effort
Fri, Nov 8, 2024, 07:39:04 - Thomas Dinges: Hey, what kind of documentation? Developer docs or user docs?
Fri, Nov 8, 2024, 07:39:09 - Julian Eisel: I think the announcement category on devtalk should be fine for that? Eventually this should be turned into a blog post I would say
Fri, Nov 8, 2024, 07:39:30 - Thomas Dinges: Yeah you can post on `Announcement`
Fri, Nov 8, 2024, 07:39:32 - Julian Eisel: <@thomasdinges:blender.org "Hey, what kind of documentation?..."> Educator docs :) They will get a new place for this on docs.blender.org

Fri, Nov 8, 2024, 07:43:03 - Julian Eisel: See, that's why we need some public communication about what this is :)
Fri, Nov 8, 2024, 07:43:38 - Pablo Vazquez: it's more like an open curriculum that teachers can follow to teach Blender, instead of everyone coming up with their own 
Fri, Nov 8, 2024, 07:43:44 - LazyDodo: hey, happy to be the clueless idiot and ask the stupid questions 🙂 
Fri, Nov 8, 2024, 07:44:29 - Julian Eisel: We also proposed taking over the #blender-education:blender.org channel for this, not sure if there's a better place on matrix maybe
Fri, Nov 8, 2024, 08:19:43 - mnq: The documentation is an open curriculum for teaching. The goal is to have a shared standard.
You can find a preview here: https://blender-education.esmo.uber.space/docs/
This documentation is set up using mkdocs, in the same manner as developer-docs has been set up. Technically it's a copy of developer-docs and we added our own content to it.

Fri, Nov 8, 2024, 08:25:25 - mnq: Julian Eisel Regarding the proposal, what is the process? where or to whom do I submit the proposal?
Fri, Nov 8, 2024, 08:27:46 - Julian Eisel: It's a rather informal process with no predefined format, I'd just create a devtalk thread like these: https://devtalk.blender.org/t/new-triaging-process-proposal/36106 https://devtalk.blender.org/t/upcoming-new-developer-documentation-platform-replacing-wiki/32532

Fri, Nov 8, 2024, 08:29:31 - Julian Eisel: Yes, in the announcement category
Fri, Nov 8, 2024, 08:31:19 - Julian Eisel: Maybe it's not really a proposal at this point, more like an introduction or announcement. (Calling it "proposal" just helps signaling that things are not set in stone yet. We had cases in the past where devs were really alarmed when things were announced seemingly without a chance for them to raise concerns.)
Fri, Nov 8, 2024, 08:37:35 - Julian Eisel: Note that people will be able to comment, so maybe mention what kind of feedback you'd find useful at this point. And once the platform goes online we can do the announcement on the code.blender.org blog

Going through previous comments, alt +b is "not working" in local build from source code.

Unfortunately Mac spoken content does not work in Blender.  Asking for someone who is partially blind but who has huge potential to create great things in 3D, but this is a barrier. Any help and advice would be greatly appreciated please.
Sat, Nov 9, 2024, 06:35:58 - LazyDodo: calamity: i'd probably look into what would be needed to make the mac thing work, rather than reinventing the wheel
Sat, Nov 9, 2024, 06:42:31 - calamity: LazyDodo: I have looked into it quite extensively, but unfortunately voiceover/spoken content is not compatible with Blender interface or features
Sat, Nov 9, 2024, 06:43:20 - Wu Yiming: 🤔 there probably are APIs that tell the OS the string under hover.
Sat, Nov 9, 2024, 06:43:57 - LazyDodo: yeah, dive into the mac documentation, see what makes it tick
Sat, Nov 9, 2024, 06:49:11 - calamity: API doesn't directly provide a way to trigger macOS’s spoken content or text-to-speech features. Looks like a case of using python scripts to communicate, however I am not a coder 🤦
Sat, Nov 9, 2024, 06:50:24 - LazyDodo: yeah if you're not a coder, neither addon nor native implementation are likely gonna be your forte, your best bet would be posting the idea on [right click select](https://blender.community/c/rightclickselect/?sorting=hot)

and I'm hypothesizing that this code is causing the bug:

def execute(self, context):
        nodes, links = get_nodes_links(context)
        selected = []
        for node in nodes:
            if node.select:
                selected.append(node)

        bpy.ops.node.add_node(type='NodeFrame')
        frm = nodes.active
        frm.label = self.label_prop
        frm.use_custom_color = self.use_custom_color_prop
        frm.color = self.color_prop

        for node in selected:
            node.parent = frm

        return {'FINISHED'}

is there a way to check if a node is of type "NodeFrame"?

Sat, Nov 9, 2024, 20:03:19 - SensArice: If new feature code is suitable for other companies but does not align with Blender's development path, would uploading it to Blender’s repository be considered a "contribution" or an "occupation of public resources"?

Sun, Nov 10, 2024, 00:51:02 - @xan2622:blender.org: With the user being forced to edit mandatory text fields (Description of the error, Exact steps for others to reproduce the error ...), this will reduce bug reports like these:

Sun, Nov 10, 2024, 03:05:59 - @xan2622:blender.org: Wouldn't switching to a fully custom website dedicated to bug reports be overkill? 
I mean.. the Gitea Issues are well integrated with the rest of Gitea (links of issues or pull requests display a tooltip when you hover them, usernames are clickable and lead to the user's repositories and activity, etc). If you move Bug Reports to another website, you will lose all these features. 😥
Sun, Nov 10, 2024, 03:21:33 - Alaska: I should of explained it better. The idea was proposed to make the page where you make bug reports fully custom, but then all the bugs reports still get placed and triaged on Gitea.
Sun, Nov 10, 2024, 06:07:22 - @baardaap:blender.org: That depends entirely if the feature is useful on it's own as well.
Sun, Nov 10, 2024, 06:07:52 - @baardaap:blender.org: Features which _only_ are meant for some external tool to use and don't have value on their own are very unlikely to be accepted.
Sun, Nov 10, 2024, 06:09:03 - @baardaap:blender.org: Features which are incompatible with blenders future plans will probably  not be accepted either.
Sun, Nov 10, 2024, 06:11:14 - @baardaap:blender.org: But useful features have a reasonably good chance of being accepted. Though there's always the question of maintainability, big 'drive by feature drops' of people dropping stuff and then disappearing are frowned upon as well, because it createds more work for the maintainers.

Mon, Nov 11, 2024, 01:07:12 - Wu Yiming: 😅 ah so still an hour to go (look you guys aren't really saving any day light this way)
Mon, Nov 11, 2024, 01:43:54 - Thomas Dinges: Good morning developers, we currently have 25 open issues in the 4.3 milestone, more than last week! 🥲 
1) Please review PRs for open issues first and land them today
2) Prioritize remaining issues and fix crucial ones first.
Mon, Nov 11, 2024, 01:50:02 - Thomas Dinges: And another friendly reminder to keep milestone assignments updated. Lukas Tönne https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/issues/129145 I assume since you lowered to "Low", this is not a stopper for 4.3?
Mon, Nov 11, 2024, 01:55:00 - @lukastonne:blender.org: Thomas Dinges: yes because this is more a question of tool design than a regression
Mon, Nov 11, 2024, 01:55:26 - @lukastonne:blender.org: would be nice to fix but given the circumstances this is not the most urgent issue
Mon, Nov 11, 2024, 01:59:30 - Thomas Dinges: We are two days away from the RC, a call has to be made if an issue is absolutely necessary for the release or not. If something is still assigned to the 4.3 milestone, I assume this one is crucial and we cannot release without. 
Mon, Nov 11, 2024, 01:59:41 - Thomas Dinges: First kick-off is now 🔔
Mon, Nov 11, 2024, 02:03:31 - @lukastonne:blender.org: oh i didn't notice the milestone, removed it

Mon, Nov 11, 2024, 02:40:07 - @sergey:blender.org: I think hans also had issues with clicking on images, but might have been something else
Mon, Nov 11, 2024, 02:40:21 - Thomas Dinges: Looking at the [4.3 documentation list](https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender-manual/issues/104823), there are a bunch of missing items still: Can people coordinate with Aaron Carlisle and help to make sure things are ready for the release?
I see missing documentation for Animation, Rendering, Compositing, Data Assets, UI, Editors, Modelling, and Geometry Nodes. Please give this message a quick 👍️ to confirm you're looking into things. Thanks
Mon, Nov 11, 2024, 02:51:55 - Pablo Vazquez: Sergey strange, there's no such thing as "lightbox plugin", since it is built-in WordPress and out of our control. I don't get the issue though, will reply on devtalk

Mon, Nov 11, 2024, 07:44:30 - Thomas Dinges: Sebastian Parborg: I don't know why Campbell wanted to bump it, if there is an issue that will be fixed with the update would be nice I guess, otherwise it is what it is. 
Mon, Nov 11, 2024, 07:44:48 - LazyDodo: it's just raising the minimum version so there's a check if people are formatting with outdated versions
Mon, Nov 11, 2024, 07:44:59 - LazyDodo: he seemed to care about it, personally i'd say is a rare event that happens anyhow
Mon, Nov 11, 2024, 07:46:17 - @zeddb:blender.org: Thomas Dinges: I bumped it with  him. It was to fix pulling in deprecated python libraries that would potentially make life hard for the extension platform.
Our old pep version was the only lib left that used these depricated libs, so we bumped it
Mon, Nov 11, 2024, 07:46:23 - LazyDodo: Thomas Dinges: the dep is bumped, what is left is blocking older versions, in one of the scripts
Mon, Nov 11, 2024, 07:47:16 - @zeddb:blender.org: Everything has been deployed from what I can see. The last point is basically a "remember to update the minimum version after all platforms have bumped"
Mon, Nov 11, 2024, 07:48:20 - Thomas Dinges: Then please bump it (should happen within next 1,5 days though, before we go RC)
Mon, Nov 11, 2024, 07:48:30 - @zeddb:blender.org: I can do it right now

Tue, Nov 12, 2024, 00:45:58 - Thomas Dinges: mnq: Not sure what the goal of the blog post would be, but if it's to get help from people I would suggest to get this setup officially first (official repository, preview available on docs.blender.org rather than a third party site). 
Tue, Nov 12, 2024, 00:46:42 - Alaska: toromail.csudh.edu The error means that the code is trying to use `MTLVertexFormatFloatRG11B10`, and what `MTLVertexFormatFloatRG11B10` means isn't properly defined in the code.

Looking at the source code on my computer, it seems you need macOS 14 or newer for that format to be defined. And you're on macOS 13. Hence why you're getting the error.
Tue, Nov 12, 2024, 00:48:09 - Thomas Dinges: Alaska: Would be good to check with the Viewport module then, docs still say you need macOS 11.2 or newer to compile Blender https://developer.blender.org/docs/handbook/building_blender/mac/
Tue, Nov 12, 2024, 00:48:27 - Thomas Dinges: So either it's a bug that should be fixed, or docs updated. Clément Foucault 
Tue, Nov 12, 2024, 00:49:20 - Thomas Dinges: toromail.csudh.edu: Please do NOT post the same error / ask for help on other channels. 
Tue, Nov 12, 2024, 00:52:09 - Alaska: Thomas Dinges: If I open up mtl_shader.hh, go to that variable and select `Go to definition`, I get this:
```
    MTLVertexFormatFloatRG11B10 API_AVAILABLE(macos(14.0), ios(17.0)) = 54,
```
So it does seem you need macOS 14, or maybe macOS SDK 14 (And I'm not 100% sure if you can get newer SDK versions on older macOS versions).

Looking at the code and code history, the use of `MTLVertexFormatFloatRG11B10` seems to have been added in 4.4. So it was a recent change.

Tue, Nov 12, 2024, 02:07:52 - @bartvdbraak:blender.org: Not logged out on chrome neither after closing and restarting 😕
Tue, Nov 12, 2024, 02:08:05 - @jacqueslucke:blender.org: I seem to have the same issue in firefox.
`id` works, `projects` does not

Tue, Nov 12, 2024, 02:08:20 - @bartvdbraak:blender.org: Have you tried re-logging into Blender ID?
Tue, Nov 12, 2024, 02:08:27 - @bartvdbraak:blender.org: Maybe it's something with your current session?
Tue, Nov 12, 2024, 02:08:27 - @donovane:blender.org: Make sure you didn't use a cleaner in background
Tue, Nov 12, 2024, 02:08:46 - @bartvdbraak:blender.org: Donovane: I would expect a cleaner to also log him out of Blender ID.
Tue, Nov 12, 2024, 02:08:55 - @bartvdbraak:blender.org: But that doesn't seem to happen.
Tue, Nov 12, 2024, 02:09:16 - @jacqueslucke:blender.org: Well, I just logged in using firefox for the first time, but will try again
Tue, Nov 12, 2024, 02:09:23 - @donovane:blender.org: Try to clean you're cookie & session and try again 🤷‍♂️
Tue, Nov 12, 2024, 02:09:25 - @bartvdbraak:blender.org: Ah okay fair point.
Tue, Nov 12, 2024, 02:12:11 - @jacqueslucke:blender.org: Some thing after clearing everything in firefox.
Tue, Nov 12, 2024, 02:12:14 - @bartvdbraak:blender.org: It's weird that it also happens in a fresh browser.
Tue, Nov 12, 2024, 02:12:25 - @bartvdbraak:blender.org: That makes it seems like it's server-side.
Tue, Nov 12, 2024, 02:12:59 - @jacqueslucke:blender.org: When I click on `Sign In` on projects.blender.org it immediately asks for the two factor authentication code. So I don't have to log into id.blender.org again.
Tue, Nov 12, 2024, 02:14:11 - @bartvdbraak:blender.org: Wait.. 2FA on Gitea?
Tue, Nov 12, 2024, 02:14:19 - @jacqueslucke:blender.org: yes
Tue, Nov 12, 2024, 02:14:22 - @bartvdbraak:blender.org: That must be the reason
Tue, Nov 12, 2024, 02:14:29 - @bartvdbraak:blender.org: I have 2FA on Blender ID login
Tue, Nov 12, 2024, 02:14:44 - @bartvdbraak:blender.org: Let me test it
Tue, Nov 12, 2024, 02:15:37 - @jacqueslucke:blender.org: That sounds reasonable. I don't even see where I can setup 2FA for id.blender.org tbh
Tue, Nov 12, 2024, 02:16:14 - @bartvdbraak:blender.org: It's an experimental feature possibly, currently only available to some beta-testers.
Tue, Nov 12, 2024, 02:16:16 - @bartvdbraak:blender.org: I'd have to ask Anna or Oleg.
Tue, Nov 12, 2024, 02:17:38 - @bartvdbraak:blender.org: Yeah, with 2FA on Gitea I can reproduce.
Tue, Nov 12, 2024, 02:17:59 - @jacqueslucke:blender.org: ok nice. That definitely used to work before, I set that up many months ago
Tue, Nov 12, 2024, 02:18:21 - @bartvdbraak:blender.org: We haven't done any releases of Gitea for a while now..
Tue, Nov 12, 2024, 02:19:18 - @jacqueslucke:blender.org: Ok, I can't pinpoint when it broke exactly unfortunately.
Tue, Nov 12, 2024, 02:19:29 - @jacqueslucke:blender.org: Good to know that you can reproduce it.
Tue, Nov 12, 2024, 02:19:42 - @bartvdbraak:blender.org: Yeah thanks for letting me know.
Tue, Nov 12, 2024, 02:20:05 - @bartvdbraak:blender.org: I think as soon as we have 2FA on blender ID it makes sense to let users use that instead.
Tue, Nov 12, 2024, 02:20:14 - @bartvdbraak:blender.org: Then the whole auth flow is consolidated there.
Tue, Nov 12, 2024, 02:20:19 - @jacqueslucke:blender.org: Yes, that sounds good to me too.
Tue, Nov 12, 2024, 02:21:24 - @jacqueslucke:blender.org: Is there any timeline for that?
I'm just wondering right now if I should disable 2FA for now if it's too annoying.
Tue, Nov 12, 2024, 02:22:27 - @bartvdbraak:blender.org: I don't know personally, but I will ask 🙂
Tue, Nov 12, 2024, 02:23:52 - @jacqueslucke:blender.org: thx
Tue, Nov 12, 2024, 02:48:24 - @fclem:blender.org: Alaska: was my doing. I cleaned up this part of the code and made the switch cases handle all cases but didn't think about availability of all cases. 

WHat's the proper way of checking for a macos version inside a switch statement?
Tue, Nov 12, 2024, 02:51:14 - Alaska: @fclem You could try:
```
#if defined(MAC_OS_VERSION_14_0)
  Your_code
#endif
```

Tue, Nov 12, 2024, 02:52:09 - Alaska: Cycles does this to avoid using the wrong metal language version. 
Tue, Nov 12, 2024, 02:52:19 - Falk David: Will take a look
Tue, Nov 12, 2024, 02:53:25 - Falk David: Have a fix, Pratik Borhade will commit
Tue, Nov 12, 2024, 02:57:22 - Falk David: pushing
Tue, Nov 12, 2024, 02:58:20 - Falk David: Done
Tue, Nov 12, 2024, 03:26:08 - mnq: FYI: one of Pete's students won this years 3D animation prize in the yearly UK's young animators competition: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42113898 .... all done in Blender of course. Last year a Blender animation also won the prize.
Tue, Nov 12, 2024, 03:48:01 - @steffend:blender.org: Building current main on Linux is giving me errors:

Tue, Nov 12, 2024, 03:49:28 - @steffend:blender.org: <@steffend:blender.org "Building current main on Linux i..."> 0e37d6fd3dba7b2716c71069b94d286759d4e11f builds fine but with lots of warnings while building cycles kernels
Tue, Nov 12, 2024, 04:06:47 - @fclem:blender.org: toromail.csudh.edu: fixed in main
Tue, Nov 12, 2024, 04:32:20 - Thomas Dinges: weizhen: Hey, can you take a look at these compile errors please?^^ 
Tue, Nov 12, 2024, 04:45:39 - Bastien Montagne: Thomas Dinges: FYI going to move BKE_imahe.h to proper cpp header in 4.3 branch (related to https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/issues/125787 nightmare)
Tue, Nov 12, 2024, 04:46:36 - @weizhen:blender.org: SteffenD: do you build with any options? The build bot did not complain
Tue, Nov 12, 2024, 04:46:59 - @weizhen:blender.org: Build bot is not building on GPU for those devices I guess?
Tue, Nov 12, 2024, 04:57:25 - @steffend:blender.org: No special options. Only thing that might be a problem is that I'm using Optix 8.0. Might that be a problem? Has been no problem so far.
Tue, Nov 12, 2024, 05:01:07 - Alaska: The problem is that the code isn't setup properly for GPU support. It will likely give this error with CUDA, OptiX, HIP, oneAPI, and Metal.
Tue, Nov 12, 2024, 05:01:30 - @weizhen:blender.org: Metal has no problem
Tue, Nov 12, 2024, 05:16:27 - Alaska: 
This fixes it for me here with CUDA. (Just putting `ccl_device_inline_method` before the functions)
```cpp
template<typename T> struct Interval {
  T min;
  T max;

  ccl_device_inline_method bool is_empty() const
  {
    return min >= max;
  }

  ccl_device_inline_method bool contains(T value) const
  {
    return value >= min && value <= max;
  }
};
```
Tue, Nov 12, 2024, 05:22:27 - @weizhen:blender.org: Thanks, I'm still setting up my Linux machine but encounter some other errors 😅
If it fixes the problem you can make a commit? The change looks correct to me
Tue, Nov 12, 2024, 05:47:38 - @weizhen:blender.org: Finally I got Blender compiled on linux. I'll make the commit then
Tue, Nov 12, 2024, 06:00:11 - Alaska: Feel free to make the commit. Sorry I didn't see the message earlier.
Tue, Nov 12, 2024, 06:04:57 - @weizhen:blender.org: SteffenD: should be fixed now
Tue, Nov 12, 2024, 06:12:53 - Wu Yiming: why ctrl+number for subdiv crashes in main
Tue, Nov 12, 2024, 06:26:58 - @steffend:blender.org: Awesome, it's compiling again! Thanks a lot 🙂
Tue, Nov 12, 2024, 06:36:49 - @fclem:blender.org: <@chengdulittlea:blender.org "why ctrl+number for subdiv crash..."> It doesn't for me
Tue, Nov 12, 2024, 06:37:08 - Wu Yiming: Ok I'll try pull again and see
Tue, Nov 12, 2024, 06:37:55 - Falk David: Are you using vulkan maybe?

eh now this...? (not on vk)
Tue, Nov 12, 2024, 07:10:21 - Wu Yiming: Oh come on why my nvidia driver is dead
Tue, Nov 12, 2024, 07:13:41 - Jeroen Bakker: nouveau means new btw :-) So it can't be worse than official drivers :-)
Tue, Nov 12, 2024, 07:15:13 - Wu Yiming: Looks like if I boot an older kernel the nvidia driver is ok... No idea what the system is doing
Tue, Nov 12, 2024, 07:16:07 - Jeroen Bakker: Depends on how you install it. Some systems I have I need to reinstall the NVIDIA driver after each kernel update.
Tue, Nov 12, 2024, 07:16:31 - Wu Yiming: I did install vulkantools... And some related Vulkan stuff
Tue, Nov 12, 2024, 07:17:08 - Jeroen Bakker: Vulkan is mostly wrappers and loaders, no actual drivers.
Tue, Nov 12, 2024, 07:18:01 - LazyDodo: there's gotta be an icd in there somewhere for it to work

Tue, Nov 12, 2024, 08:54:29 - Thomas Dinges: Also please make sure the release notes/manual is up to date
Tue, Nov 12, 2024, 09:29:59 - Iliya Katushenock: No LTS, right?
Tue, Nov 12, 2024, 09:33:03 - Thomas Dinges: 4.3 is not an LTS, no
Tue, Nov 12, 2024, 09:34:39 - Julian Eisel: Might be good to start preparing that, yeah. Would also be good to address some of the questions people asked in there. But maybe wait with publishing it until the platform is more ready indeed.
Tue, Nov 12, 2024, 10:11:55 - sentharn: How do the render tests work? Is the source available? I'd like to set up my Arc and nVidia desktops to run them automatically on some of my scenes daily to catch differences between the two. 
Tue, Nov 12, 2024, 10:13:42 - LazyDodo: sentharn:  did you check the [developer handbook](https://developer.blender.org/docs/handbook/)?
Tue, Nov 12, 2024, 10:14:32 - sentharn: Didn't know it existed. Thanks. I mostly just report bugs when my Arc card does something "special".
Tue, Nov 12, 2024, 10:18:10 - sentharn: Oh good, it looks like I can add my cursed scenes without having to figure out how to share them. Perfect 👍
Tue, Nov 12, 2024, 13:55:01 - mnq: <@julianeisel:blender.org "Might be good to start preparing..."> What is the purpose of the blog post? On devtalk I'm explaining to non-educators how education works and how this project fits in. I'm afraid that writing a blog post on code.blender.org will only create noise.
Tue, Nov 12, 2024, 14:01:37 - Nika Kutsniashvili: Is the goal simply to have nomenclature that some few schools around you share? If not, then you should be seeing point in explaining to people what that project is. If this isn't global, public, and well documented how is this official Blender project?
Tue, Nov 12, 2024, 14:21:17 - Hans Goudey: I wouldn't assume you're explaining things to non educators
Tue, Nov 12, 2024, 14:21:30 - Hans Goudey: Seemed like some things were just worth clarifying
